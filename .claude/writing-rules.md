# Writing Style Rules

When writing any content (blog posts, page copy, descriptions, marketing text), follow these rules strictly:

## Avoid Unnecessary Dashes
- Never use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--)
- Avoid en dashes except for number ranges (e.g., "10-15%")
- Instead of dashes for parenthetical thoughts, use commas, periods, or parentheses
- Bad: "We handle everything — from cleaning to guest communication — so you can relax"
- Good: "We handle everything from cleaning to guest communication, so you can relax"
- Bad: "Our service is simple - we manage, you earn"
- Good: "Our service is simple. We manage, you earn."

## Write Like a Human, Not AI
To avoid AI detection patterns:

1. **Vary sentence structure unpredictably.** Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones. Start some with "And" or "But". Fragment sentences work too.

2. **Use casual transitions.** Instead of "Furthermore" or "Additionally", use "Also", "Plus", "On top of that", or just start a new thought.

3. **Avoid these AI giveaway words/phrases:**
   - "delve", "utilize", "leverage", "streamline", "seamlessly"
   - "In today's [anything]", "In the realm of", "It's important to note"
   - "Whether you're looking to...", "When it comes to..."
   - "This ensures that...", "This allows you to..."
   - "comprehensive", "robust", "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art"

4. **Be specific, not generic.** Instead of "our team of experts", say "our local GTA managers". Instead of "quality service", describe what makes it quality.

5. **Use contractions naturally.** "we're", "you'll", "don't", "won't", "can't"

6. **Include minor imperfections.** Real writing has personality. Use colloquialisms. Reference local things. Be opinionated.

7. **Avoid perfect parallel structure.** AI loves lists where every item follows the same pattern. Mix it up.

8. **Write conversationally.** Read it out loud. If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite it.

9. **Skip unnecessary qualifiers.** Delete "very", "really", "extremely", "highly" most of the time.

10. **Be direct.** Say what you mean. Don't pad sentences with filler phrases.
