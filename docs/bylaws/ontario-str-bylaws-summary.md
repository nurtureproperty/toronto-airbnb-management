## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NURTURE CLIENTS

1. **Always verify** - Bylaws change frequently. Check official city websites before listing.

2. **Condo rules** - Even if city allows STRs, condo corporations can prohibit them.

3. **Mid-term rentals (30+ days)** - Often exempt from STR regulations. Good alternative in restricted areas.

4. **Investment properties** - Most regulated cities do NOT allow STRs on non-principal residences.

5. **Insurance** - Standard homeowner's insurance usually doesn't cover STR activity. Get specialized coverage.

6. **HST Registration** - Required if earning $30,000+/year from STRs.

7. **Platform compliance** - Airbnb/VRBO may require license numbers and may collect MAT automatically.
