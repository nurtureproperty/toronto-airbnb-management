          <h2>Why Choose Nurture Stays?</h2>

          <h3>Local Toronto Expertise</h3>
          <p>We're not a faceless national company. We live and work in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. We know the neighborhoods, the regulations, and what guests want. From <a href="/downtown-toronto-airbnb-management">Downtown condos</a> to <a href="/mississauga-airbnb-management">Mississauga properties</a>, we have local teams ready.</p>

          <h3>Toronto Airbnb Regulations</h3>
          <div class="bylaw-box">
            <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
            <p>Toronto requires STR registration, limits rentals to your principal residence, and caps nights at 180 when you're away. You are responsible for obtaining your own registration. Airbnb automatically collects MAT tax on your behalf.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Not Your Principal Residence?</h4>
            <p>Consider <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">mid-term rentals</a> (30+ days). No STR license needed, still earn 30-50% more than long-term tenants.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Transparent Pricing</h3>
          <p>Just 12-15% of revenue. No setup fees, no hidden costs, no long contracts. We only make money when you make money. See our full <a href="/pricing-toronto-airbnb-management">pricing details</a>.</p>

          <h3>Tips for Airbnb Success in Toronto</h3>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Tip #1: Respond Fast</h4>
            <p>Airbnb's algorithm rewards quick responses. Our less than 9-minute average keeps your listing ranking high.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Tip #2: Professional Photos Matter</h4>
            <p>Listings with professional photos earn 20-30% more. We include <a href="/services/airbnb-photography">professional photography</a> at no extra cost.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Tip #3: Price Dynamically</h4>
            <p>Static pricing leaves money on the table. Our AI adjusts rates for events, seasons, and demand through our <a href="/services/airbnb-dynamic-pricing">dynamic pricing service</a>.</p>

        <h2>Toronto Airbnb Management FAQ</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does Airbnb management cost in Toronto?</h3>
          <p>Nurture charges 12-15% of your rental revenue with no setup fees, no hidden costs, and no long-term contracts. Most Toronto Airbnb management companies charge 18-25%, making Nurture one of the most competitively priced options in the GTA. We only make money when you make money. See our full <a href="/pricing-toronto-airbnb-management">pricing breakdown</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much can I earn from Airbnb in Toronto?</h3>
          <p>Earnings depend on location, property type, and seasonality. A one bedroom condo in downtown Toronto typically earns $3,500 to $5,000/month on Airbnb, compared to $2,000 to $2,500 as a long-term rental. Properties near the waterfront, Entertainment District, and major transit hubs command premium rates. Read our detailed <a href="/blog/how-much-can-i-make-airbnb-toronto-2026">Toronto Airbnb earnings guide</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need a license to Airbnb in Toronto?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Toronto requires all short-term rental operators to register with the city. You can only rent your principal residence, and entire home rentals are capped at 180 nights per year. You are responsible for obtaining your own STR registration. Airbnb automatically collects the 8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT) on your behalf. Read our complete <a href="/blog/toronto-airbnb-short-term-rental-regulations-2026">Toronto Airbnb regulations guide</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I Airbnb my investment property in Toronto?</h3>
          <p>Toronto's STR bylaws require properties to be your principal residence. Investment properties generally cannot be used for short-term rentals under 28 days. However, <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">mid-term rentals</a> (30+ days) are not subject to STR regulations and can earn 30-50% more than traditional long-term tenants. We help many investment property owners with this approach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I Airbnb my condo in Toronto?</h3>
          <p>It depends on your condo corporation's rules. Even though the City of Toronto allows STRs, individual condo boards can prohibit them. Check your condo's declaration and rules first. We have a list of <a href="/blog/toronto-condos-that-allow-airbnb-short-term-rental">Toronto condos that allow Airbnb</a>. If your condo board permits short-term rentals, you'll still need city registration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What services does Nurture's Airbnb management include?</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How quickly can I get my first Airbnb booking?</h3>
