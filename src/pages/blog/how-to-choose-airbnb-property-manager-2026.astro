const faqs = [
  { q: "What percentage do Airbnb property managers charge in the GTA?", a: "GTA property managers typically charge 10-30% of booking revenue. Starter-tier managers charge 10-15% for core services like listing creation, guest messaging, dynamic pricing, and screening. Full-service managers charge 15-20% and add cleaning coordination, supplies, and a dedicated account manager. Premium concierge managers charge 20-30% for luxury-level service. Beyond the percentage, ask whether the fee is calculated on gross or net revenue. A 15% fee on net revenue (after Airbnb platform fees, cleaning costs, and taxes are deducted) costs significantly less than 15% on gross bookings." },
  { q: "Should I use Airbnb's Co-Host Network to find a property manager?", a: "Airbnb's Co-Host Network is a good starting point for finding individual co-hosts, with an average rating of 4.86 stars. However, co-hosts typically handle fewer services than full property management companies. They may not offer professional cleaning coordination, multi-platform distribution, or dynamic pricing optimization. For GTA hosts looking for hands-off management with higher revenue potential, a full PM company often provides better value." },
  { q: "What's the difference between commission on gross vs net revenue?", a: "This is one of the most overlooked questions when comparing property managers. A PM charging 15% on gross revenue takes their cut from the total booking amount before any expenses are deducted. A PM charging 15% on net revenue only takes their cut after Airbnb's platform fee, cleaning costs, supplies, and applicable taxes are subtracted. On a property earning $4,500/month gross, the difference between 15% on gross ($675) and 15% on net (roughly $450) is over $2,700 per year back in your pocket. Always ask how the management fee is calculated and get it in writing." },
  { q: "What's the biggest red flag when hiring an Airbnb property manager?", a: "The single biggest red flag is a property manager who creates your Airbnb listing under their company account instead of yours. This means they control your reviews, your calendar, your Superhost status, and your guest relationships. If you ever leave, you start from zero with no reviews and no booking history. Always ensure you own your listing." },
  { q: "How long does it take to get my first booking with a property manager?", a: "With a competent property manager, expect your first booking within one to two weeks of going live. Top-performing PMs achieve this through professional photography, optimized listing copy, competitive launch pricing, and multi-platform distribution across Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com. If a PM can't get you booked within the first month, something is wrong." },
  { q: "Do I need a property manager, or should I self-manage my Airbnb?", a: "It depends on your time, location, and comfort level. Self-managing saves the management fee but requires 10-15 hours per week for guest communication, cleaning coordination, pricing adjustments, and maintenance. A property manager handles everything for 10-15% of revenue (some charge on net revenue after expenses, which is even less) and typically generates 30-100% more income through professional pricing, optimized listings, and faster response times. For most GTA hosts, the net income after management fees exceeds what they'd earn self-managing." },
  { q: "What should I look for in a property management contract?", a: "Look for month-to-month terms with 30-day cancellation notice, a clear fee structure with no hidden charges, confirmation that you own your listing, defined service scope, transparent reporting requirements, and a communication policy. Avoid contracts with early termination penalties, lock-in periods exceeding 3 months, or vague language about additional fees." }

            <p class="lead">The right Airbnb property manager can increase your revenue by 30-100% and make hosting completely hands-off. The wrong one can lock you into contracts, tank your reviews, hold your listing hostage, and cost you more than self-managing. <strong>The GTA has dozens of Airbnb management companies, and the quality varies wildly.</strong> Here's how to separate the professionals from the ones who will waste your money.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why This Decision Matters</h2>
          <p>Choosing a property manager isn't like picking a cleaning company. This person or company controls your income, your reviews, your guest experience, and your property's reputation. A great PM optimizes your pricing daily, responds to guests within minutes, coordinates professional cleanings, and handles everything from supply restocking to review management. A bad PM does the bare minimum while charging you for premium service.</p>

          <p>The financial impact is significant. A well-managed listing can earn <a href="/blog/how-much-can-i-make-airbnb-toronto-2026" style="color: var(--color-primary-dark); text-decoration: underline;">$3,500 to $5,000+ per month</a> in the GTA. A poorly managed one might pull in $1,500 while the PM still collects their percentage. The difference between a good and bad property manager can be $20,000 or more per year on the same property.</p>

          <p>And unlike other service providers, switching property managers is painful. If your PM created your listing under their account, you lose all your reviews, your Superhost status, and your search ranking. That's months of momentum gone. So it pays to get this decision right the first time.</p>

          <h2 id="checklist">The 10-Point Checklist for Evaluating Any Property Manager</h2>
          <p>Use this checklist when evaluating any Airbnb property manager in the GTA. Don't skip any of these, and don't accept vague answers.</p>

          <div class="steps-grid">
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">1</span>
              <h4>Who Owns the Listing?</h4>
              <p>This is the most important question you'll ask. <strong>You should own your Airbnb listing, always.</strong> If the PM creates listings under their company account, they control your reviews, your calendar, your guest relationships, and your Superhost status. If you ever leave, you start from zero. No reviews, no history, no search ranking. A reputable PM will create or manage the listing under your personal Airbnb account.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">2</span>
              <h4>What's the Contract Length?</h4>
              <p>Month-to-month contracts are the gold standard. Lock-in contracts of 6 to 12 months with early termination fees protect the PM, not you. If a company is confident in their service, they don't need to trap you with a contract. Look for 30-day cancellation clauses. If a PM insists on a minimum commitment, ask yourself why they need legal force to keep their clients.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">3</span>
              <h4>What's the Total Fee Structure?</h4>
              <p>Ask for every single fee, not just the management percentage. Some companies advertise 15% but charge 25%+ when you add up setup fees, cleaning markups, supply markups, linen fees, photography charges, and maintenance coordination fees. Also ask whether the commission is calculated on gross revenue or net revenue after expenses. A PM charging 15% on net (after Airbnb fees, cleaning, and taxes are deducted) costs you meaningfully less than 15% on gross. Get the total cost structure in writing. A transparent PM will have a simple fee structure with no surprises.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">4</span>
              <h4>How Do They Communicate?</h4>
              <p>Can you reach a dedicated account manager who knows your property? Or do you get a generic support inbox and wait in a queue? Some PMs use group chats where your message gets lost among dozens of other owners. You should have direct access to someone who knows your property inside and out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">5</span>
              <h4>What's Their Response Time?</h4>
              <p>The industry average for guest response times is measured in hours. Good PMs respond within 15 minutes. The best local GTA managers track this publicly and average under 10 minutes. Ask for their actual average response time, not a vague "we respond quickly." Fast response times directly impact your search ranking on Airbnb and your guest satisfaction scores. If a PM can't tell you their exact average, they probably don't track it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">6</span>
              <h4>Do They Use Dynamic Pricing?</h4>
              <p>Flat-rate pricing leaves 15-40% of your potential revenue on the table. Professional PMs use tools like PriceLabs or Beyond Pricing to adjust your rates daily based on demand, seasonality, local events, and competitor pricing. If a PM sets your price at $150/night and walks away, they're not optimizing your income. Read more in our <a href="/blog/airbnb-dynamic-pricing-tools-guide-2026" style="color: var(--color-primary-dark); text-decoration: underline;">dynamic pricing guide</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">7</span>
              <h4>How Do They Handle Cleaning?</h4>
              <p>Cleaning is the most visible part of the guest experience. Ask whether they coordinate professional cleaners, whether cleaning quality is checked between turnovers, and whether they have backup cleaners when the primary team is unavailable. A missed or poor cleaning leads to bad reviews faster than almost anything else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">8</span>
              <h4>What's Their Local Market Expertise?</h4>
              <p>A PM based in Vancouver or a national franchise managing your Toronto listing won't understand GTA-specific seasonal demand patterns or neighborhood dynamics. Ask where their team is based and how many GTA properties they manage. Local knowledge matters for pricing strategy, vendor relationships, and knowing which events and festivals drive demand in your area.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">9</span>
              <h4>Is the Commission on Gross or Net Revenue?</h4>
              <p>This question alone can save you thousands per year. Some PMs take their commission on the total booking amount before any deductions. Others calculate their fee on net revenue, after Airbnb's platform fee (typically 3-15%), cleaning costs, supplies, and applicable taxes are subtracted. On a property earning $4,500/month gross, the difference between 15% on gross ($675) and 15% on net (roughly $450) is over $2,700 per year. Always ask for the calculation in writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">10</span>
              <h4>Can You See Real Client Results?</h4>
              <p>Ask for Google reviews, client references, occupancy data, and revenue examples. Good PMs are proud to share results. Check their average Airbnb rating across managed properties (4.8+ is strong, 4.9+ is exceptional). Ask for specific examples of properties similar to yours and what revenue they've generated. The best managers will show you before-and-after numbers from real clients. If they can't provide concrete data, that tells you something.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags That Should Make You Run</h2>
          <p>If you encounter any of these during your evaluation, proceed with extreme caution or walk away entirely.</p>

              <strong>The #1 Red Flag: Listing Under Their Name</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">If a property manager insists on creating your Airbnb listing under their company account, this is the single biggest warning sign in the industry. Your reviews, your Superhost status, and your entire booking history belong to them. You have zero leverage if you want to leave, and they know it.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long lock-in contracts with early termination penalties:</strong> A 12-month contract with a $2,000 cancellation fee means the PM doesn't trust their service to retain you. Good PMs keep clients because they deliver results, not because of legal penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Onboarding or setup fees of $500+:</strong> You shouldn't pay hundreds or thousands of dollars before your property has earned a single dollar. Professional photography and listing creation should be included in the management service.</li>
            <li><strong>Markups on cleaning, supplies, or linen:</strong> If your cleaner charges $100 and your PM bills you $150, that's a 50% markup you're paying for no reason. Ask whether cleaning and supply costs are passed through at cost or marked up.</li>
            <li><strong>"Vacancy fees" or minimum monthly charges:</strong> Some PMs charge you even when the property isn't booked. This removes their incentive to maximize your occupancy. A commission-only model aligns the PM's interests with yours.</li>
            <li><strong>No transparent reporting or monthly statements:</strong> You should receive detailed monthly reports showing bookings, revenue, expenses, and occupancy. If a PM can't or won't provide clear financial reporting, you'll never know if you're getting fair value.</li>
            <li><strong>Promises that sound too good to be true:</strong> "Guaranteed $5,000/month" or "100% occupancy" are unrealistic promises that no honest PM would make. Revenue depends on seasonality, market conditions, and your property type. Be wary of anyone who guarantees specific income numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Commission calculated on gross revenue:</strong> Some PMs take their percentage from the total booking amount before Airbnb fees, cleaning costs, and taxes are deducted. This means you're paying them a cut of money that never reaches your bank account. A PM who charges on net revenue (after all platform fees and operating expenses) is giving you a fundamentally better deal at the same percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>Management fees above 25% for standard service:</strong> In the GTA market, paying more than 25% for basic Airbnb management is above market rate. Premium concierge-level services may justify higher fees, but standard listing, messaging, and pricing optimization should not cost a quarter of your revenue.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication only through group chats or generic email:</strong> If you can't get a real person on the phone who knows your property, your issues will always be deprioritized. Direct contact with a dedicated account manager is what professional management looks like.</li>
            <li><strong>No local office or team in the GTA:</strong> A PM who manages your Toronto property from another province won't have reliable local cleaners, maintenance contacts, or understanding of municipal regulations. Local presence is essential for handling emergencies and guest issues.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="green-flags">Green Flags of a Great Property Manager</h2>
          <p>These are the qualities that separate professional property managers from the rest. The more of these boxes a PM checks, the more confident you can be in your choice.</p>

          <p>Notice how many companies say "varies" or don't disclose pricing? That's a red flag. If they won't tell you their fee structure upfront, expect surprises later.

              <strong>The Fee Percentage Is Only Half the Story</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">A PM charging 15% on gross revenue takes $675 from a $4,500 booking month. A PM charging 15% on net revenue (after ~$1,500 in Airbnb fees, cleaning, and supplies) takes roughly $450 from that same month. That's $225/month difference, or $2,700/year, on the same advertised percentage. Then factor in hidden fees: setup charges, cleaning markups, supply markups, and vacancy fees can push your real cost well past 25%. Always compare the total annual cost, not just the headline number.</p>

          <h2 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to Ask Before Signing</h2>
          <p>Bring this list to your initial consultation with any property manager. Their answers (and any hesitation) will tell you everything you need to know.</p>

          <div class="steps-grid">
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">1</span>
              <h4>"Will the Airbnb listing be under my account or yours?"</h4>
              <p>The only acceptable answer is yours. If they hesitate or explain why it's "better" under their account, end the conversation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">2</span>
              <h4>"Can you provide a complete list of every fee I'll pay?"</h4>
              <p>Ask them to itemize: management percentage, setup fee, cleaning cost, supply restocking, linen service, photography, maintenance coordination, and anything else. Get it in writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">3</span>
              <h4>"What's your average guest response time?"</h4>
              <p>Ask for real data, not a vague answer. If they can't tell you their actual average, they probably don't track it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">4</span>
              <h4>"What dynamic pricing tool do you use?"</h4>
              <p>If the answer is "we set prices manually" or "we use a fixed rate," they're leaving money on the table. Professional PMs use tools like PriceLabs, Beyond, or Wheelhouse.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">5</span>
              <h4>"Can I speak with two or three current clients?"</h4>
              <p>A PM who won't connect you with references is hiding something. Current clients will tell you the real story about communication, responsiveness, and revenue performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">6</span>
              <h4>"What happens if I want to cancel?"</h4>
              <p>Look for 30-day notice with no penalties. Ask specifically about early termination fees, notice periods, and what happens to existing bookings after cancellation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">7</span>
              <h4>"How do you handle cleaning and what does it cost?"</h4>
              <p>Find out if they coordinate professional cleaners, whether there's a quality check process, and whether cleaning costs are passed through at cost or marked up.</p>
            </div>

              <span class="step-number">8</span>
              <h4>"What's your average Airbnb rating across managed properties?"</h4>
              <p>Strong PMs maintain 4.8+ ratings. If they can't answer this question or their average is below 4.7, their operations may need work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">9</span>
              <h4>"Is your management fee calculated on gross or net revenue?"</h4>
              <p>Many hosts never think to ask this, but it significantly affects your take-home income. A PM who charges on net revenue (after platform fees, cleaning, and taxes) is giving you a better deal than the same percentage on gross. If they charge on gross, factor that into your total cost comparison.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step-card">
              <span class="step-number">10</span>
              <h4>"Which platforms do you list on besides Airbnb?"</h4>
              <p>Multi-platform distribution (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com) increases your visibility and occupancy. A PM who only lists on Airbnb is limiting your earning potential.</p>

          <h2 id="co-host-network">Airbnb's Co-Host Network</h2>
          <p>In 2024, Airbnb launched its own Co-Host Network, a marketplace connecting hosts with local co-hosts who can help manage their properties. The average co-host rating on the platform is 4.86 stars, and it's a useful tool for finding individual managers.</p>

          <h3>What It Offers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vetted co-hosts:</strong> Airbnb screens co-hosts based on their hosting track record, ratings, and experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible arrangements:</strong> You negotiate the fee and scope of work directly with the co-host.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform integration:</strong> Co-hosts access your listing directly through Airbnb's tools, making handoff straightforward.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviews and ratings:</strong> You can see how other hosts have rated each co-host before hiring.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Limitations to Consider</h3>
          <p>The Co-Host Network works well for individual co-hosts, but it has some limitations compared to full property management companies.</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Limited Service Scope</h4>
              <p>Most co-hosts handle guest messaging and check-ins but may not offer professional cleaning coordination, <a href="/blog/airbnb-dynamic-pricing-tools-guide-2026" style="color: var(--color-primary-dark); text-decoration: underline;">dynamic pricing</a>, multi-platform distribution, or supply management. You may need to coordinate these yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Limited Revenue Optimization</h4>
              <p>Individual co-hosts typically don't invest in professional <a href="/blog/airbnb-dynamic-pricing-tools-guide-2026" style="color: var(--color-primary-dark); text-decoration: underline;">dynamic pricing tools</a>, listing optimization, or professional photography. These are the services that drive the 30-100% revenue increases that full PM companies deliver.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="alternatives-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Single-Platform Focus</h4>
              <p>Co-hosts found through Airbnb's network typically only manage your Airbnb listing. They won't distribute your property to VRBO, Booking.com, or other channels that could increase your occupancy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Backup Coverage</h4>
              <p>An individual co-host may not have backup coverage when they're sick, on vacation, or unavailable. A PM company has a team that ensures your property is always covered.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The Co-Host Network is a solid starting point if you want light-touch help. For comprehensive management in the GTA, including cleaning coordination, multi-platform distribution, dynamic pricing, and dedicated support, a full property management company typically provides more value.</p>
