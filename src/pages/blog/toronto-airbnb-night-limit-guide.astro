const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I rent my Airbnb for more than 180 nights?", a: "Yes, through two legal methods. First, you can register for partial-unit rentals where you rent rooms while remaining home, which has no night limit. Second, you can switch to mid-term rentals of 28+ consecutive days, which are completely exempt from STR regulations." },
  { q: "Does the limit reset at the start of each year?", a: "Yes, the 180-night limit is calculated per calendar year, resetting every January 1st. You must track nights across all platforms combined." },
  { q: "Can I switch between entire-unit and partial-unit registration?", a: "Not easily. When you register, you must declare either entire-unit or partial-unit rental. To change, you would need to apply for a new registration with the city." },
  { q: "What qualifies as a mid-term rental?", a: "Any rental of 28 consecutive days or more is not considered a short-term rental under Toronto's bylaws. These rentals are exempt from registration requirements, the 180-night limit, and the principal residence rule." },
  { q: "Can I do mid-term rentals on my investment property?", a: "Yes. Since mid-term rentals (28+ days) are not classified as short-term rentals, they do not require principal residence status. This is a legal way to rent investment properties." },
  { q: "Do Toronto's rules apply to Mississauga or Brampton?", a: "No. Toronto's STR bylaws only apply within City of Toronto boundaries. Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, and other GTA cities have their own separate regulations." },
  { q: "Is Airbnb still worth it with all these restrictions?", a: "Absolutely. Even with the 180-night limit, many hosts earn 30-100% more than traditional long-term rentals. You can also combine strategies by using entire-unit Airbnb for 180 nights, then mid-term rentals for the remaining months." },
  { q: "Can I rent my basement apartment on Airbnb?", a: "Yes, if the basement is your principal residence. Secondary suites, laneway houses, and garden suites within your principal residence are all eligible for STR registration." },
  { q: "What records do I need to keep?", a: "You must maintain records showing your registration number displayed on all ads, dates and duration of each rental, contact info for each renter, and proof of principal residence. Keep records for at least 3 years." }

            <p class="lead">Toronto's short-term rental regulations include a <strong>180-night annual limit</strong> for entire home rentals, but that's not the whole story. Understanding the nuances of partial-unit rentals, mid-term strategies, and exactly what the bylaws say can help you maximize your rental income while staying fully compliant.</p>
            <p class="lead">This comprehensive guide breaks down everything from the official City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 547, including strategies many hosts don't know about.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-limit">What is the 180-Night Limit?</h2>
          <p>Toronto's Municipal Code Chapter 547 states clearly:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No operator who holds a registration to operate an entire-unit rental shall rent a property for more than 180 nights per calendar year."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-4.1.1.D</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This limit specifically applies to <strong>entire-unit rentals</strong>, meaning rentals where guests occupy your complete dwelling unit while you're not present. The limit is calculated per calendar year (January 1 to December 31), and nights across all booking platforms count toward this total.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> The 180-night limit only applies to entire-unit rentals. Partial-unit rentals (renting rooms while you remain home) have <strong>no night limit at all</strong>. This is a critical distinction in the bylaws that many hosts overlook.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="partial-unit">Partial-Unit Rentals: The No-Limit Option</h2>
          <p>Under Toronto's bylaws, there are two types of short-term rental registrations:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Entire-Unit Rental</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Partial-Unit Rental</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Guests occupy the entire dwelling</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Guests occupy part of dwelling while you're home</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">180 nights per year maximum</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>NO night limit</strong></div>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>What Qualifies as a Partial-Unit Rental?</h3>
          <p>According to the official bylaw definition:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Partial-unit rental means a short-term rental in which a renter occupies part of a dwelling unit...while the dwelling unit is also occupied by the operator or a member of the operator's household."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>In practical terms, this means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Renting a spare bedroom</strong> while you live in the home</li>
            <li><strong>Renting a basement room</strong> while you occupy the main floor</li>
            <li><strong>Renting multiple rooms</strong> to different guests while you remain on-site</li>
            <li>You or a household member must be physically present during the rental</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="success-box">
            <h4>Partial-Unit Strategy Benefits:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Rent 365 nights per year legally</li>
              <li>No night limit restrictions</li>
              <li>On-site hosting often leads to better reviews</li>
              <li>Lower insurance requirements in some cases</li>
              <li>Easier guest management with you present</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Registration Matters</h3>
          <p>When you register for a short-term rental license, you must declare whether you're doing <strong>entire-unit</strong> or <strong>partial-unit</strong> rentals. The bylaw states:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "An application for registration shall...state whether the short-term rental is to be operated as an entire-unit rental or a partial-unit rental."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-3.1.1.C</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>You cannot freely switch between the two types. Your registration locks you into one category, so choose strategically based on your hosting plans.</p>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: Bypass the 180-Night Limit</h2>
          <p>Here's something many hosts don't realize: <strong>mid-term rentals are completely exempt from Toronto's STR regulations</strong>. The bylaws only apply to rentals under 28 consecutive days.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term rental means the use of all or part of a dwelling unit...for a rental period of less than 28 consecutive days."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
          <p>If you book a guest for 28 days or more, that rental:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Does not count</strong> toward your 180-night limit</li>
            <li><strong>Does not require</strong> STR registration</li>
            <li><strong>Is not subject</strong> to the principal residence rule</li>
            <li><strong>Does not require</strong> you to pay the 8.5% MAT tax</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>The Hybrid Strategy</h4>
            <p>Many successful Toronto hosts use a combined approach:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Peak season (May to October):</strong> Short-term Airbnb rentals to maximize nightly rates during high-demand periods</li>
              <li><strong>Shoulder season (November to April):</strong> Mid-term rentals (28+ days) to traveling professionals, students, or relocating families</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This way, you get premium rates when demand is highest and stable income during slower months, all while staying under the 180-night STR limit.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Mid-Term Rental Platforms</h3>
          <p>Several platforms specialize in mid-term rentals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Airbnb</strong> allows you to filter for 28+ day stays and offers monthly discount pricing</li>
            <li><strong>Furnished Finder</strong> is popular with traveling nurses and healthcare workers</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate housing sites</strong> cater to business travelers on extended assignments</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> has local demand for furnished monthly rentals</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="geographic-scope">Which Cities Are Covered by Toronto's Rules?</h2>
          <p>This is a common point of confusion. <strong>Toronto's STR bylaws only apply within the City of Toronto's municipal boundaries.</strong></p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card toronto">
              <h4>City of Toronto (Covered)</h4>
              <p>These areas fall under Toronto's bylaws:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Downtown Toronto</li>
                <li>North York</li>
                <li>Scarborough</li>
                <li>Etobicoke</li>
                <li>East York</li>
                <li>York</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card other">
              <h4>NOT Toronto (Separate Rules)</h4>
              <p>These have their own STR regulations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mississauga</li>
                <li>Brampton</li>
                <li>Vaughan</li>
                <li>Markham</li>
                <li>Richmond Hill</li>
                <li>Oakville</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Each municipality in the Greater Toronto Area has its own STR bylaws (or lack thereof). For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mississauga</strong> has a 180-day limit, requires principal residence, and charges $283/year for a license</li>
            <li><strong>Brampton</strong> has a 180-day limit, requires principal residence, and allows max 3 bedrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Vaughan</strong> requires principal residence plus license and MAT registration</li>
            <li><strong>Markham</strong> generally does not permit STRs under 30 days</li>
            <li><strong>Richmond Hill</strong> is currently not regulated but under review</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Always verify the specific rules for your municipality before listing.</p>

          <h2 id="registration">Registration Requirements</h2>
          <p>Before operating any short-term rental in Toronto, you must register with the city. Here's what's required:</p>

          <h3>What You Need to Register</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Proof of principal residence</strong> showing you can only register one property (the one where you ordinarily reside)</li>
            <li><strong>Declaration of rental type</strong> specifying either entire-unit or partial-unit (you must choose one)</li>
            <li><strong>Property address</strong> that must match your principal residence documentation</li>
            <li><strong>Contact information</strong> for city communications and enforcement</li>
            <li><strong>Registration fee</strong> of approximately $50 annually</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Principal Residence Rule</h3>
          <p>The bylaws are strict about what constitutes a principal residence:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal residence means the dwelling unit where an operator ordinarily resides and shall not include more than one dwelling unit."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can only have <strong>one principal residence</strong> for STR purposes</li>
            <li>Investment properties do not qualify</li>
            <li>Vacation homes do not qualify</li>
            <li>You must actually live there, not just own it</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What About Secondary Suites?</h3>
          <p>Good news: the bylaws allow STR operations in secondary suites, laneway houses, and garden suites as long as they're part of your principal residence:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "For greater certainty, a secondary suite...or a laneway suite...or a garden suite...may be an operator's principal residence."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="what-qualifies">What Properties Qualify for STR?</h2>
          <p>Under Toronto's bylaws, short-term rentals can only be operated in certain property types:</p>

          <h3>Eligible Property Types</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Single-family homes</li>
            <li>Semi-detached houses</li>
            <li>Townhouses</li>
            <li>Condominium units</li>
            <li>Apartments</li>
            <li>Secondary suites (basement apartments)</li>
            <li>Laneway houses</li>
            <li>Garden suites</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Condo Restrictions</h4>
            <p>Even if the city allows STRs, your <strong>condo corporation can prohibit them</strong>. Many Toronto condos have rules against short-term rentals. Always check your condo's declaration, bylaws, and rules before listing.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">The 8.5% MAT Tax</h2>
          <p>Toronto charges a <strong>Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</strong> of 8.5% on all short-term rentals, one of the highest rates in Ontario.</p>

          <h3>How MAT Works</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rate:</strong> 8.5% of the accommodation price</li>
            <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Airbnb, VRBO, and major platforms collect and remit automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> All rentals under 28 consecutive days</li>
            <li><strong>Exempt:</strong> Mid-term rentals (28+ days) are not subject to MAT</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As a host, you don't need to manually collect or remit MAT when using major platforms. However, be aware that this tax increases your guests' total cost, which may affect your pricing strategy.</p>

          <h2 id="why-worth-it">Why Short-Term Rentals Are Still Worth It</h2>
          <p>With all these regulations, you might wonder if Airbnb is still worthwhile in Toronto. The answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. Here's why:</p>

          <h3>1. Significantly Higher Income</h3>
          <p>Even with just 180 nights of short-term rentals, most hosts earn substantially more than traditional long-term leases:</p>

          <div class="comparison-example">
            <h4>Example: 1-Bedroom Condo in Downtown Toronto</h4>
            <div class="example-grid">
              <div class="example-item">
                <span class="label">Long-term rental</span>
                <span class="value">$2,400/month</span>
                <span class="annual">$28,800/year</span>
              </div>
              <div class="example-item highlight">
                <span class="label">Airbnb (180 nights @ $200/night)</span>
                <span class="value">$36,000/year</span>
                <span class="annual">+25% more income</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="example-note">And this doesn't include the additional income potential from mid-term rentals during the remaining 185 nights.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>2. Flexibility and Control</h3>
          <p>Unlike long-term leases, short-term rentals give you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use your own property:</strong> Block dates when you want to use your home</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust pricing:</strong> Raise rates during peak demand periods like events, holidays, and summer</li>
            <li><strong>Screen guests:</strong> Review guest profiles and reviews before accepting</li>
            <li><strong>No problem tenants:</strong> Guests leave after a few days, not months of eviction proceedings</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Hybrid Strategy Potential</h3>
          <p>The 180-night limit doesn't mean your property sits empty the rest of the year. Smart hosts combine:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>180 nights STR</strong> at premium rates during peak season</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-term rentals (28+ days)</strong> for stable income during off-season</li>
            <li><strong>Personal use</strong> with blocked time for your own enjoyment or family visits</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Growing Tourism Market</h3>
          <p>Toronto's tourism industry continues to grow, with increasing demand for short-term accommodations. Major events, business travel, and year-round attractions ensure consistent booking potential.</p>

          <h3>5. Professional Management Availability</h3>
          <p>If regulations feel overwhelming, professional property managers like Nurture handle everything including compliance tracking, guest communication, cleaning coordination, and revenue optimization. This allows you to earn passive income without the stress.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Tips for Staying Compliant</h2>
          <p>Follow these best practices to stay compliant and maximize your returns:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Track your nights religiously</strong> using a spreadsheet or property management software to monitor entire-home rental nights across all platforms. Don't rely on memory.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Display your registration number</strong> by including your valid registration number on every listing and every platform. This is required by law.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Keep detailed records</strong> of all bookings including dates, durations, guest contact info, and platform confirmations. Keep records for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Plan your calendar strategically</strong> by switching to mid-term bookings (28+ days) for the rest of the year if approaching 180 nights.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Consider partial-unit registration</strong> if you can host while home, since partial-unit registration eliminates the night limit entirely.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Verify condo rules</strong> before listing by confirming your condo corporation allows short-term rentals. Some have complete bans.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Stay informed</strong> because regulations can change. Follow city announcements and industry news for updates.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Work with professionals</strong> since a property management company can handle compliance tracking, night counting, and regulatory updates for you.</li>
          </ul>
