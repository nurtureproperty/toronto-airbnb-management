const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Oakville?", a: "No. Oakville requires the property to be your principal residence. This means you must actually live there and have it listed as your primary address on your income tax return. Investment properties, second homes, and cottages don't qualify. Mid-term rentals (29+ days) are an alternative for investment properties since they fall outside the STR definition." },
  { q: "What happens if I get too many demerit points?", a: "At 7 points, your license can be suspended for up to 6 months. At 15 points, it can be revoked entirely. Points stick to your property for 2 years from the date assessed. Common infractions that add up fast: noise violations (5 points), operating without a license (5 points), fire code violations (7 points). One bad weekend party could put you over the threshold." },
  { q: "How much does an Oakville STR license cost?", a: "The annual license fee is approximately $237 according to Oakville's fee schedule, though this can change. The license expires every October 31st regardless of when you apply, so timing your application matters. You'll also need to budget for required inspections (HVAC, electrical) and your $2M insurance policy." },
  { q: "Do I need to be available 24/7 to respond to issues?", a: "Yes, essentially. Oakville requires a Local Contact who can physically attend the property within one hour of being contacted by phone or email, at any time. If you live outside Halton Region, you must designate someone local. Many hosts use property managers to satisfy this requirement." },
  { q: "What's the maximum number of guests I can have?", a: "It depends on your floor space. With 3 adult guests, you need at least 14 square metres for the lodging unit. With 4+ adults, you need 7 square metres per person. You're also limited to a maximum of 3 lodging units total. This effectively caps larger homes at around 6-8 guests depending on room sizes." },
  { q: "Is there a night limit in Oakville like Toronto's 180-night cap?", a: "No, Oakville doesn't have an annual night limit. As long as you maintain your license in good standing and the property remains your principal residence, you can rent as many nights as you want. This is actually a significant advantage over Toronto's rules." },
  { q: "What documents do I need for the license application?", a: "Quite a bit: proof of ownership or landlord consent, floor plan with room dimensions, parking management plan, property maintenance plan, Renter's Code, $2M insurance certificate naming the Town, criminal reference check (less than 30 days old), HVAC inspection certificate, and for first-time applicants, an ESA electrical inspection from the past 6 months." },
  { q: "Can I operate an STR in my condo?", a: "Even if you get licensed by the Town, your condo corporation can prohibit short-term rentals in their declaration or rules. Many Oakville condos have restrictions. Check your condo documents before investing time in the license application. The Town's approval doesn't override private condo rules." },
  { q: "What's the Renter's Code requirement?", a: "You must create a document (approved by the Town) that explains guest responsibilities, noise expectations, parking rules, and relevant bylaws. Every guest must sign acknowledging they received it, and you keep those signed copies for at least one year. It's part of Oakville's approach to holding guests accountable for their behavior." }

          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Oakville takes short-term rentals seriously. While many GTA cities focus on night limits and registration fees, Oakville built something more sophisticated: a <strong>demerit point system</strong> that can suspend or revoke your license based on violations. Think of it like a driver's license for your Airbnb.</p>
            <p class="lead">The good news? Unlike Toronto, there's <strong>no annual night cap</strong>. You can rent year-round as long as you stay compliant. The bad news? Oakville's requirements are some of the most detailed in Ontario. Let's break down what you actually need to know.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Oakville's By-law 2018-045 defines a short-term accommodation pretty specifically:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Accommodation or STA means the provision of a dwelling unit which is used for the temporary lodging of the travelling public for a rental period not greater than 28 consecutive days or less in exchange for payment."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So any rental of <strong>28 days or less</strong> falls under these rules. Book a guest for 29+ days, and you're in mid-term rental territory, which doesn't require STR licensing. This is an important distinction because mid-term rentals also don't require principal residence status.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Key difference from Toronto:</strong> Oakville has no annual night limit. You can rent all 365 nights if you want, as long as you maintain your license and it's your principal residence. Toronto caps entire-unit rentals at 180 nights per year.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is where most investment property dreams go to die. Oakville requires STRs to be operated from your principal residence:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal Residence means a property that is owned or rented alone or jointly with another person, where the person(s) is ordinarily a resident and has designated the property as their principal residence on their income tax filing and in other government records."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This isn't just about ownership. You need to actually live there and have the paper trail to prove it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income tax return</strong> listing it as your principal residence</li>
            <li><strong>Government records</strong> (driver's license, health card) showing this address</li>
            <li><strong>Actual residency</strong> - you must "ordinarily reside" there</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Property Owners</h4>
            <p>You cannot operate a short-term rental on a property that isn't your principal residence. Period. For investment properties in Oakville, your best option is mid-term rentals (29+ consecutive days), which fall outside STR regulations and don't require this principal residence status.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="demerit-system">The Demerit Point System</h2>
          <p>This is Oakville's secret weapon for enforcement. Every violation adds points to your license, and accumulate too many and you're out of business.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>How Points Are Assessed</h3>
          <p>Points aren't automatic - they're triggered by confirmed violations:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The number of demerit points...will be assessed against a Short-Term Accommodation in respect of the matter noted in Column 1 upon the following event respecting a contravention: the confirmation of an administrative penalty; the confirmation of an order..."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 Schedule 3 § 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>How Fast Points Add Up</h4>
            <p>Here's a real scenario: Your guest throws a loud party on a Saturday night. Neighbours call bylaw.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Noise violation with fine:</strong> 5 points</li>
              <li><strong>Parking violations (cars on lawn):</strong> 3 points</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's <strong>8 points from one incident</strong> - enough for license suspension. And those points stick around for 2 years. This is why guest vetting and house rules matter so much in Oakville.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Application Requirements</h2>
          <p>Oakville's application is one of the most thorough in Ontario. Here's everything you need:</p>

          <h3>Documentation Checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong> (transfer/deed) or landlord consent if renting</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing all rooms with dimensions in square metres, and which rooms are lodging units</li>
            <li><strong>Parking Management Plan</strong> compliant with zoning bylaw, showing all parking space locations and dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Property Maintenance Plan</strong> covering compliance with property standards, garbage/recycling locations, snow storage, and responsible party</li>
            <li><strong>Renter's Code</strong> (Town-approved document for guests)</li>
            <li><strong>Criminal Reference Check</strong> - must be less than 30 days old at application time</li>
            <li><strong>HVAC inspection certificate</strong> from certified technician</li>
            <li><strong>ESA electrical inspection</strong> (for initial applications, within past 6 months)</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance certificate</strong> ($2M liability, naming Town of Oakville)</li>
            <li><strong>Sworn declaration</strong> confirming compliance with Building Code, Fire Code, Electrical Safety Code, and that you're the principal resident</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A completed application for a licence or for renewal of a licence shall be submitted to the Licensing Commissioner accompanied by the requirements prescribed in Schedule 1, and any other information that the Licensing Commissioner may from time to time request."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 § 3.1</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>License Term</h3>
          <p>All Oakville STR licenses expire on <strong>October 31st annually</strong>, regardless of when you applied. So if you get licensed in September, you'll be renewing just two months later. Plan accordingly.</p>

          <h2 id="local-contact">The Local Contact Requirement</h2>
          <p>If you don't live in Halton Region, you must designate a Local Contact. Even if you do live locally, having backup is smart.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Local Contact means an agent or representative of an Owner who does not reside in the Regional Municipality of Halton, who is responsible for managing or addressing issues in relation to the Owner's Short-Term Accommodation."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The key requirement:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Ensure that there is a Local Contact available to attend to the STA at all times within a period of no greater than one hour from the time of contact by way of telephone or e-mail."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 Schedule 2 § 2(g)</cite>
          </blockquote>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Oakville requires substantial coverage:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Proof of insurance which includes a liability limit of no less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence for property damage and bodily injury, and identifies that a STA is being operated on the property."
            <cite>Oakville By-law 2018-045 Schedule 1 § 2(j)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> liability per occurrence</li>
            <li><strong>Must identify</strong> that an STA is being operated</li>
            <li><strong>Town notification:</strong> Policy must give Oakville 10 days' written notice of cancellation or material changes</li>
            <li><strong>Standard homeowner's insurance won't cut it</strong> - you need STR-specific coverage</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Oakville uses a tiered administrative penalty system:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Violation</div>

            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">First offense</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$300</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Second offense (within 24 months)</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$400</strong></div>
            </div>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$500</strong></div>
            </div>

            "Every person who contravenes any of the provisions of this by-law...is guilty of an offence and on conviction liable to a fine not exceeding $25,000 for a first offence and $50,000 for any subsequent offence. Where a corporation is convicted...the maximum penalty is $50,000 for a first offence and $100,000 for any subsequent offence."

          <h2 id="mat-tax">The 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax</h2>
          <p>Oakville charges a <strong>4% MAT</strong> on short-term accommodations. This is lower than Toronto's 8.5% but still adds up.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Applies to stays under 28 days</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Airbnb collects automatically</strong> in most cases</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-term rentals (29+ days)</strong> are exempt</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For a $250/night stay, guests pay an extra $10/night in MAT. Factor this into your pricing strategy, as it affects what guests ultimately pay.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Oakville</h2>
          <p>Given the demerit point system, compliance isn't optional. Here's how to protect your license:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Vet guests thoroughly.</strong> One party can cost you 8+ points and a suspension. Check reviews, ask about trip purpose, and trust your instincts. Declining a sketchy booking is better than losing your license.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Make your Renter's Code crystal clear.</strong> Include specific quiet hours, parking rules, maximum occupancy, and consequences. Have guests sign it before check-in and keep copies for at least a year.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Maintain 1-hour response capability 24/7.</strong> Either live nearby, have a reliable co-host, or work with a property manager. Missing a bylaw call costs points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Keep your paperwork current.</strong> License expires October 31st every year. Insurance certificates need to stay valid. HVAC inspections should be up to date.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Document everything.</strong> Guest records (date, length of stay, home address, Renter's Code confirmation) must be available for inspection for one year.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Post your license visibly.</strong> It needs to be displayed "permanently in a prominent place" in the STA. Not posting it is 1-3 points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Know your parking and property plans.</strong> You submitted these with your application. Violations of either are demerit points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Check condo rules first.</strong> Even with a Town license, your condo corporation can ban STRs. Their rules override municipal permission.</li>
          </ul>
