const faqs = [
  { q: "What is Airbnb co-hosting and how does it differ from property management?", a: "Airbnb co-hosting is an arrangement where a second person helps manage your listing while you retain full ownership and control. You stay the primary host, keep your listing under your name, and direct which tasks the co-host handles. Full property management is a more turnkey arrangement where a company takes over operations entirely, though you still own the property and listing with a reputable manager like Nurture." },
  { q: "How much does a co-host typically charge in Toronto?", a: "Co-host fees in the GTA typically range from 10% to 25% of rental revenue depending on the scope of work. Guest communication only runs 10-15%. Communication plus cleaning coordination costs 15-20%. Full co-hosting (handling everything except ownership) is 15-25%. Nurture's co-hosting service starts at 10%, with full management at 15%." },
  { q: "What does a co-host actually do day to day?", a: "A co-host handles the operational side of running your Airbnb: responding to guest inquiries, coordinating check-ins and check-outs, managing cleaning schedules, handling minor guest issues, adjusting prices, and writing review responses. What they don't handle includes major maintenance, your insurance and compliance obligations, furnishing decisions, or photography." },
  { q: "How does Airbnb's official Co-Host Network work?", a: "Airbnb launched its Co-Host Network in 2024 to connect hosts with vetted co-hosts in their area. You can search for local co-hosts, view their experience and reviews from other hosts, negotiate the scope of work and fees, and add them to your listing through Airbnb's platform. Airbnb facilitates the connection and provides tools for setting permissions, but does not manage the financial arrangement between host and co-host." },
  { q: "Is co-hosting income taxable in Ontario?", a: "Yes. Co-hosting income is considered self-employment or business income in Canada and must be reported on your personal tax return. If you earn more than $30,000 annually from co-hosting, you must also register for GST/HST. Keep records of all income and eligible expenses. Consult a tax professional familiar with Canadian rental income rules to maximize your deductions." },
  { q: "When should I choose co-hosting over full property management?", a: "Co-hosting makes sense if you want to stay actively involved in decisions about your listing, pricing strategy, and guest selection. It's also a good fit if you have time to oversee operations and just need help with specific tasks like guest messaging or cleaning coordination. Full management is better if you want a completely hands-off experience, travel frequently, or own multiple properties." },
  { q: "What are the red flags when hiring a co-host in Toronto?", a: "Watch for these warning signs: the co-host wants to operate the listing under their name (not yours), they have no verifiable reviews from other hosts, they can't provide references, their fee structure is unclear or has hidden charges, they have no local presence in the GTA, or they're slow to respond during the vetting process. A co-host who is slow to respond before you hire them will be slow to respond to your guests." },
  { q: "Can Nurture act as a co-host rather than a full property manager?", a: "Yes. Nurture offers both co-hosting and full management services. Our co-hosting arrangement starts at 10% of rental revenue and covers guest communication, check-in management, pricing optimization, and review responses. Full management at 15% adds cleaning coordination, linen and supply restocking, and a dedicated account manager. Both options have no long-term contracts, and your listing always stays under your name." }

            <p class="lead">You want help running your Airbnb, but you're not ready to hand everything over to a management company. <strong>Airbnb co-hosting sits in the middle: someone else handles the day-to-day work while you keep full ownership, full control, and full visibility into your listing.</strong> This guide breaks down how co-hosting works in Toronto, what it costs, and how to decide whether co-hosting or full management is right for your situation.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-co-hosting">What Is Airbnb Co-Hosting?</h2>
          <p>Co-hosting is an arrangement where you, as the listing owner and primary host, bring on a second person to help manage your Airbnb. The listing remains under your name and account. You own the listing, you collect the income, and you make the key decisions. The co-host handles specific operational tasks on your behalf.</p>

          <p>Think of it like hiring a contractor to handle parts of a project. You're still the client directing the work. The co-host simply executes the day-to-day tasks that would otherwise consume your time.</p>

            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"></line>
                <line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"></line>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>The Core Distinction:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">With co-hosting, you stay the primary host. Your listing, your Airbnb account, your relationship with guests. A co-host is added to your account with specific permissions you control. This is fundamentally different from handing your property to a management company that operates it under their account.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Co-hosting has become increasingly popular as GTA hosts look for ways to reduce their workload without giving up the income premium that comes from running their own Airbnb. <a href="/blog/airbnb-self-manage-vs-property-manager-2026">Self-managing an Airbnb costs hosts 17-34 hours per week</a>. Co-hosting eliminates most of that time while keeping you in the driver's seat.</p>

          <h2 id="co-host-network">Airbnb's Official Co-Host Network</h2>
          <p>In 2024, Airbnb launched its Co-Host Network, a marketplace that connects property owners with vetted, experienced co-hosts in their area. Before this, finding a co-host meant relying entirely on personal referrals or local hosting groups.</p>

          <h3>How the Matching Process Works</h3>
          <p>Through the Co-Host Network, you search for co-hosts based on location, languages spoken, and the specific services you need. Each co-host profile shows their experience level, the services they offer, and reviews from other hosts who have worked with them.</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Browse and Request</h4>
              <p>Search for co-hosts near your property in Toronto or the GTA. Review profiles, experience, and host reviews. Send a request to co-hosts whose services match your needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Agree on Scope and Fees</h4>
              <p>Negotiate directly with the co-host on what tasks they'll handle and what percentage they'll earn. Airbnb facilitates the connection but does not set the fee structure.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="alternatives-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Add to Your Listing</h4>
              <p>Once you agree, add the co-host to your Airbnb account with specific permissions. You control what they can see and do, from full access to messaging-only access.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Set Payout Split</h4>
              <p>Airbnb allows you to set an automatic payout split so the co-host receives their percentage directly from each booking. No manual transfers needed.</p>

              <strong>Co-Host Network Availability</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">The Airbnb Co-Host Network is still rolling out across markets. Availability in Toronto and the GTA may be limited depending on your specific neighbourhood. An alternative is to work directly with a local property management company like Nurture that offers structured co-hosting arrangements with clear contracts and track records.</p>

          <h2 id="co-host-vs-management">Co-Host vs Full Property Management: Key Differences</h2>
          <p>The decision between co-hosting and full property management comes down to how much control you want to retain and how hands-off you want to be. Here's a direct comparison across every factor that matters.</p>

          <p class="table-note">Note: Reputable full-service managers like Nurture always operate listings under the owner's name. Be cautious of any company that insists on operating the listing under their own account.</p>

          <p>One thing that surprises many hosts: full management from a quality company often costs the same or less than co-hosting. The reason is that professional managers operate at scale, coordinating cleaning and maintenance more efficiently than a solo co-host. The <a href="/blog/airbnb-self-manage-vs-property-manager-2026">net income after fees is often higher</a> with professional management because of superior pricing optimization and occupancy rates.</p>

          <h2 id="revenue-splits">Typical Co-Host Revenue Splits in the GTA</h2>
          <p>Co-host fees vary depending on the scope of work. There is no standardized rate, so understanding what's typical for each service level helps you evaluate proposals.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Guest Messaging</h4>
              <p>Responding to every inquiry, pre-booking question, and in-stay message. Response time matters: Airbnb rewards fast replies with higher placement in search results. Nurture averages a 9-minute response time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Check-In Management</h4>

            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Pricing Adjustments</h4>
              <p>Monitoring local demand, competitor rates, and platform data to adjust nightly prices. This single task has the largest impact on revenue, with professional pricing adding 30-64% above baseline.</p>

              <h4>Cleaning Coordination</h4>

          <h3>What Co-Hosts Typically Do Not Handle</h3>
          <p>There are limits to what a co-host takes on. Understanding these boundaries prevents misaligned expectations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Major maintenance and repairs:</strong> Plumbing, appliance failures, and structural issues are the owner's responsibility to coordinate and fund.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory compliance:</strong> STR licensing, MAT tax remittance, insurance requirements, and condo board approval remain the owner's obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Furnishing and photography:</strong> Initial setup, furniture selection, and professional listing photos are typically owner-arranged. Some full management companies like Nurture offer photography assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance claims:</strong> Filing claims for property damage is an owner responsibility, though a good manager helps document incidents thoroughly.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial and tax reporting:</strong> Co-hosts manage the listing, not your books. Income reporting and HST remittance are your responsibility.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="finding-a-co-host">How to Find a Co-Host in Toronto</h2>
          <p>There are three main ways GTA hosts find co-hosts, each with different trade-offs.</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Airbnb Co-Host Network</h4>
              <p>Airbnb's built-in marketplace for finding vetted co-hosts. The advantage is transparency: you see verified reviews from other hosts and can set payment splits directly through the platform. Availability in specific Toronto neighbourhoods may vary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Local Hosting Groups</h4>
              <p>Facebook groups and communities like r/TorontoAirbnbHosts connect you with experienced local hosts. Referrals from trusted community members reduce the vetting effort and you can find someone who already knows your neighbourhood.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="alternatives-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Property Management Companies</h4>
              <p>Companies like Nurture offer structured co-hosting arrangements with formal agreements, clear fee structures, and documented track records. This is the most professional option for hosts who want reliability without vetting a solo operator.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Personal Referrals</h4>
              <p>Ask other GTA hosts who they use. A co-host with a satisfied client willing to give a reference is far lower risk than someone you found through a cold search. The Toronto hosting community is active and referrals flow freely.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Red Flags When Choosing a Co-Host</h3>
          <p>Not every co-host is the right fit. These warning signs should give you pause before signing any arrangement.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wants to run the listing under their name:</strong> Your listing belongs under your account. Any co-host who insists on being the primary host is creating a situation where they control your asset.</li>
            <li><strong>No host references or reviews:</strong> A co-host with no verifiable track record is an unknown risk. Ask for contact information for two or three current clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Unclear fee structure:</strong> If a co-host can't clearly explain what their percentage covers and what extra charges might apply, that ambiguity will cost you later.</li>
            <li><strong>No local presence in the GTA:</strong> A co-host who lives two hours away cannot handle in-person issues when a guest is locked out at midnight. Local presence matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow response during vetting:</strong> A co-host who takes days to respond to your initial messages will take days to respond to your guests. Response speed during the sales process reveals their operating style.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure to sign quickly:</strong> Good co-hosts have enough clients that they don't need to rush you into a decision. Urgency tactics suggest limited options on their end.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="when-to-choose">When Co-Hosting Makes Sense vs When Full Management Is Better</h2>
          <p>Neither option is universally superior. The right choice depends on your goals, your time availability, and how involved you want to be.</p>

          <h3>Choose Co-Hosting If...</h3>
          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Want Active Oversight</h4>
              <p>You like approving pricing decisions, reviewing guest profiles before booking, and being kept in the loop on everything happening at your property.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Have Time to Supervise</h4>
              <p>You're available to handle escalations, coordinate maintenance, and make decisions. Co-hosting reduces your time investment but doesn't eliminate it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Want Specific Help</h4>
              <p>You manage pricing and guest communication fine, but cleaning coordination is a headache. Co-hosting lets you delegate that single task without handing over full control.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Choose Full Management If...</h3>
          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Want True Passive Income</h4>
              <p>You're not available to make decisions, handle escalations, or supervise operations. Full management delivers income while you focus on other priorities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Own Multiple Properties</h4>
              <p>Managing multiple listings, even with co-host help, becomes operationally complex. A full management company has the systems to handle multiple properties efficiently.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Want Maximum Revenue</h4>
              <p>Professional managers with <a href="/blog/airbnb-dynamic-pricing-tools-guide-2026">dynamic pricing tools</a>, optimized listings, and high-volume operations consistently outperform self-managed or co-hosted properties on revenue.</p>

The combination of dynamic pricing, optimized listing copy, faster response times, and higher review scores drives enough incremental revenue to more than offset the management cost. The math almost always favours professional help over self-managing.</p>

          <h2 id="tax-implications">Tax Implications of Co-Hosting Income in Ontario</h2>
          <p>Whether you're the host earning rental income or the co-host earning service fees, tax obligations apply to both sides of the arrangement.</p>

          <h3>If You're the Property Owner (Host)</h3>
          <p>Airbnb income is taxable in Canada as either rental income or business income, depending on the level of services you provide. Most Airbnb hosts report their income as rental income on Schedule T776. You can deduct expenses proportional to the rental use of your property, including the co-host fee, mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and depreciation.</p>

          <p>If your total rental income exceeds $30,000 in any calendar year, you must register for a GST/HST account and charge and remit HST on rental revenue. Airbnb may collect and remit HST on your behalf in some situations, but verify this with a tax professional.</p>

          <h3>If You're the Co-Host</h3>
          <p>Co-hosting fees are business income and must be reported on your personal tax return. As a self-employed service provider, you can deduct business expenses: your phone, vehicle use for property visits, software subscriptions, and a portion of your home office if you work from home.</p>

          <p>If your co-hosting income exceeds $30,000 annually, you must register for GST/HST and charge 13% HST on your service fees. This is a common oversight among casual co-hosts that can create unexpected tax liability.</p>

              <strong>2024 Federal Rule: Deductions for Non-Compliant STRs</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">A 2024 federal rule denies expense deductions for STR income earned from properties that are not compliant with local short-term rental bylaws. If your Airbnb operates without the required license in Toronto or other regulated GTA cities, you may lose the ability to deduct legitimate expenses against that income. Compliance is now a direct tax issue, not just a regulatory one.
