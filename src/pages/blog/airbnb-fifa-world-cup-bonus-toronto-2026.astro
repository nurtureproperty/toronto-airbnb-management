const faqs = [
  { q: "How much can I earn hosting during the FIFA World Cup in Toronto?", a: "According to Deloitte research commissioned by Airbnb, Toronto hosts can expect to earn an average of $2,700 USD during the tournament period. That's on top of Airbnb's $1,000 CAD bonus for new hosts. Hotel prices are expected to spike 107% above normal, meaning Airbnb listings priced competitively will see strong demand." },
  { q: "What is Airbnb's $1,000 new host incentive?", a: "Airbnb is offering approximately $1,000 CAD ($750 USD) to new entire home hosts in World Cup host cities. You must sign up at airbnb.com/new-host-fifa before publishing your listing, welcome your first guest by July 31, 2026, and complete a qualifying reservation of at least $100 USD before taxes." },
  { q: "Do I need to register my STR with the City of Toronto?", a: "Yes. You must register with the City and display your STR registration number (format: STR-0000-XXXXXX) on all listings. The 2026 renewal fee is $390. You can register online at secure.toronto.ca. Operating without registration can result in fines up to $100,000." },
  { q: "Can I rent my investment property during the World Cup?", a: "No. Toronto's principal residence rule still applies during the World Cup. You can only short-term rent the home where you actually live. For investment properties, consider mid-term rentals (30+ days) which fall outside STR regulations." },
  { q: "What is the MAT tax rate during the World Cup?", a: "Toronto temporarily increased the Municipal Accommodation Tax to 8.5% (up from 6%) effective June 1, 2025 through July 31, 2026. This increase was specifically implemented to help fund World Cup hosting costs. You must collect and remit this tax on all bookings." },
  { q: "When are the Toronto World Cup matches?", a: "Toronto hosts 6 matches between June 12 and July 2, 2026. The first match on June 12 is historic: Canada's first ever men's FIFA World Cup match on home soil. Additional matches feature Germany, Ghana, Croatia, Senegal, and a Round of 32 knockout game." },
  { q: "Does the 180-night limit affect World Cup hosting?", a: "The 180-night annual limit applies to entire home rentals only. If you rent rooms in your home while you're present, there's no night limit. For most hosts, the World Cup window (roughly 3 weeks) won't come close to the limit unless you've already used most of your nights." },
  { q: "What type of listings are in highest demand for the World Cup?", a: "Families and groups account for more than half of World Cup bookings, with 75% of family bookings requesting 2 or 3 bedroom listings. Two-night stays are most common (30% of bookings), followed by 4 to 5 night stays (20%). If you have a multi-bedroom home, you're in a strong position." },
  { q: "Is there a FIFA Fan Festival in Toronto?", a: "Yes. The FIFA Fan Festival runs at Fort York National Historic Site and The Bentway for the entire tournament duration, June 11 through July 19. It features live match broadcasts, cultural performances, and local food. It's free to attend, which means visitors will be in Toronto even on non-match days." },
  { q: "How do I get started as a new Airbnb host for the World Cup?", a: "First, register at airbnb.com/new-host-fifa to lock in the $1,000 CAD incentive. Then register with the City of Toronto for your STR number. Create your listing with professional photos and competitive pricing. Or contact Nurture to handle everything from listing creation to guest communication." }

          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Airbnb is paying new Toronto hosts <strong>$1,000 CAD</strong> to list their home for the FIFA World Cup 2026. It's their biggest new host incentive ever, and it's available right now. With over <strong>300,000 visitors</strong> expected, hotel prices projected to double, and six matches at BMO Field between June 12 and July 2, this is the biggest short-term rental opportunity Toronto has ever seen.</p>
            <p class="lead">Here's exactly how the bonus works, what you can earn on top of it, and how to stay compliant with Toronto's STR rules.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="airbnb-incentive">Airbnb's $1,000 FIFA World Cup Bonus: How It Works</h2>
          <p>Airbnb is calling this their "biggest new host incentive program ever." The FIFA World Cup bonus pays approximately <strong>$1,000 CAD ($750 USD)</strong> to new hosts in all 16 World Cup cities, including Toronto and Vancouver. Here's the breakdown:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Approximately $1,000 CAD ($750 USD)</li>
            <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> New hosts or anyone with no active home listings as of February 1, 2026</li>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sign up at <strong>airbnb.com/new-host-fifa</strong> before publishing your listing</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Publish an entire home listing (not a private room)</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Complete a qualifying reservation (minimum $100 USD before taxes) by July 31, 2026</li>
            <li><strong>Important:</strong> Cancelled stays don't count. You must register on the FIFA page <em>before</em> publishing your listing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>So you get the bonus on top of whatever you earn from the booking itself. For a new host earning $2,700+ during the tournament period, that's nearly $4,000 total. Not bad for a few weeks of hosting.</p>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Pro Tip: Don't Wait Until June</h4>
            <p>The incentive is available now, and Airbnb's algorithm favors listings with reviews. If you list your place in March or April and get a few bookings (and reviews) before the World Cup, your listing will rank higher in search results when the big demand hits. Early listings also get a "new listing boost" from Airbnb's algorithm.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="opportunity">Why This Is a Once in a Generation Opportunity</h2>
          <p>The $1,000 bonus is just the appetizer. Let's talk about the main course. This isn't just "a big event." It's the largest sporting event on the planet coming to your backyard.</p>

          <p>With downtown hotels projected at $500 to $800 per night, Airbnb hosts offering clean, well-priced alternatives are going to clean up. (Pun absolutely intended.)</p>

          <p>The economic impact for the GTA alone is projected at <strong>$940 million</strong> in total economic output, $520 million in GDP, and over 6,600 jobs created. This is real money flowing into the city, and hosts are positioned to capture a meaningful share of it.</p>

          <h2 id="earnings">Expected Earnings (On Top of the Bonus)</h2>
          <p>Deloitte (commissioned by Airbnb) put together some projections that are worth paying attention to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Average Toronto host earnings:</strong> $2,700 USD during the tournament</li>
            <li><strong>Vancouver hosts (for comparison):</strong> $4,200 USD average</li>
            <li><strong>Average across all 16 host cities:</strong> $3,000 USD per host</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These are averages. Hosts with well-optimized listings, professional photos, and competitive pricing will earn significantly more. A well-managed 2 bedroom condo near BMO Field or downtown could easily pull $300 to $500 per night during peak match weekends.</p>

          <p>For context, 85% of Toronto Airbnb listings are priced under $500/night, and 67% of 2+ bedroom listings are under $500. With hotels averaging $531/night, there's a massive sweet spot for Airbnb hosts to offer better value while still earning premium rates.</p>

          <h2 id="match-schedule">Toronto Match Schedule</h2>
          <p>BMO Field has been expanded from 30,000 to <strong>45,000 seats</strong> with a $146 million renovation. Toronto hosts 6 matches total: 5 group stage and 1 knockout round.</p>

          <h2 id="regulations">Toronto STR Rules You Must Follow</h2>
          <p>The World Cup doesn't create any exemptions from <a href="/blog/toronto-airbnb-short-term-rental-rules-2026">Toronto's existing STR regulations</a>. Here's the checklist:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Principal residence only:</strong> You can only STR the home where you actually live. Investment properties don't qualify</li>
            <li><strong>Registration required:</strong> You need an STR number (STR-0000-XXXXXX) displayed on all listings. Fee: $390 for 2026</li>
            <li><strong>180-night annual limit:</strong> Applies to entire home rentals only. No limit on private rooms while you're home</li>
            <li><strong>$2M liability insurance:</strong> Required for all registered STR operators</li>
            <li><strong>Safety compliance:</strong> Smoke alarms, CO detectors, fire extinguishers</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Enforcement Is Tightened for 2026</h4>
            <p>Toronto has reduced the STR registration revocation process from 40 days to just 10 days. The city is cracking down on unregistered operators, especially ahead of the World Cup. Operating without registration can result in fines up to $100,000. Get registered now.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">The 8.5% MAT Tax Increase</h2>
          <p>Here's something many hosts don't know yet: Toronto <strong>temporarily increased the Municipal Accommodation Tax from 6% to 8.5%</strong>, effective June 1, 2025 through July 31, 2026. This was specifically implemented to help fund World Cup hosting costs.</p>

          <p>The city expects this increase to generate an additional $56.6 million. For hosts, this means:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You must collect <strong>8.5% MAT</strong> on all bookings during this period</li>
            <li>Airbnb collects and remits MAT automatically on your behalf</li>
            <li>Rooms fully booked and paid before June 1, 2025 are exempt from the increase</li>
            <li>Partial prepayments or deposits do <strong>not</strong> qualify for the exemption</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Don't let the tax increase scare you. With hotel rates at $531/night average, guests are expecting to pay premium prices. The 8.5% MAT is a minor factor when your listing offers genuine value compared to a hotel room at double the price.</p>

          <h2 id="demand">Who Is Coming to Toronto (And What They Want)</h2>
          <p>Understanding your guests helps you optimize your listing. Here's what the data shows:</p>

          <h3>Guest Demographics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Families and groups</strong> account for more than half of all World Cup Airbnb bookings</li>
            <li><strong>75% of family bookings</strong> are for 2 and 3 bedroom listings</li>
            <li><strong>Gen Z travelers</strong> represent over 15% of Canadian bookings, with nearly half traveling in groups</li>
            <li>Top source countries: <strong>United States, United Kingdom, and Canada</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Stay Patterns</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>2-night stays</strong> are most common (30% of bookings)</li>
            <li><strong>4 to 5 night stays</strong> are second most popular (20%)</li>
            <li>Germans are visiting the most destinations. Argentinians are booking the longest trips</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Listing Optimization for World Cup Guests</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Multi-bedroom wins:</strong> If you have 2 or 3 bedrooms, emphasize this in your title and photos</li>
              <li><strong>Minimum stay:</strong> Consider setting a 2-night minimum during match weekends to maximize revenue</li>
              <li><strong>Transit access:</strong> Highlight proximity to BMO Field, TTC stations, or the Fan Festival at Fort York</li>
              <li><strong>International guests:</strong> Make sure your listing description mentions nearby restaurants, grocery stores, and transit in clear English</li>
