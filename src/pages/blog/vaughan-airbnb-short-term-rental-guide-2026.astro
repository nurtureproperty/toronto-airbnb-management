const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Vaughan?", a: "Nope, and this trips up a lot of investors. Vaughan only allows STRs at your principal residence, the place where you actually live. That condo you bought near VMC hoping to Airbnb it? Won't fly. But here's the workaround we use with clients: mid-term rentals of 30+ days aren't considered short-term rentals, so they're exempt from all these rules." },
  { q: "Is there a night limit for Airbnb in Vaughan?", a: "This is where Vaughan beats Toronto and Mississauga hands down. There's no annual night cap at all. You can rent your principal residence 365 days a year if you want. Compare that to the 180-night limit in Toronto and Mississauga. It's a huge advantage for Vaughan hosts." },
  { q: "How much is the Vaughan STR license?", a: "The fees are set by their Fees and Charges By-law 171-2013, and they update periodically. Check the City of Vaughan website for current rates. Just know it's non-refundable and you'll need to renew it every year. Don't let it lapse or you'll face late penalties." },
  { q: "Can a corporation own an STR license in Vaughan?", a: "No, and this catches people off guard. Only individual persons can hold a license. Not corporations, not partnerships, not LLCs. If you've structured your property under a holding company, you'll need to work around this." },
  { q: "Do I need a background check for a Vaughan STR license?", a: "Yes, and it's specifically a Vulnerable Sector Check from an Ontario police service. Make sure it's dated within 90 days of your application or they'll reject it. Plan ahead because these can take a few weeks to get, especially in busy seasons." },
  { q: "Can I rent my condo on Airbnb in Vaughan?", a: "Only if your condo corporation allows it. You'll need a letter from the building owner or condo board confirming STRs are permitted. And honestly? A lot of Vaughan condos have banned short-term rentals regardless of what the city says. Check your condo rules first before you even think about applying for a license." },
  { q: "Can I rent to multiple groups at the same time?", a: "Absolutely not. The bylaw specifically prohibits overlapping reservations. You can't rent the basement to one group and the upstairs to another. One booking at a time, period." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Vaughan and Toronto rules?", a: "Two big differences. First, Vaughan's STR threshold is 29 days while Toronto's is 28, so a 29-day rental is short-term in Vaughan but mid-term in Toronto. Second, Vaughan has zero night limit while Toronto caps you at 180 nights per year. Both require principal residence and licensing though." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Here's something most people don't realize about Vaughan's Airbnb rules: there's <strong>no annual night limit</strong>. That's right. While Toronto and Mississauga cap you at 180 nights, Vaughan lets you rent your principal residence year-round. It's honestly one of the better STR setups in the GTA.</p>
            <p class="lead">But there's a catch. You still need a license, you still need to live there, and you'll need to pass a background check. The rules are laid out in <strong>By-Law 158-2019</strong> (amended multiple times through 2025), and I'll walk you through everything: what counts as short-term, who qualifies, and how to actually get licensed.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Let's start with the basics. In Vaughan, any rental of <strong>29 consecutive days or less</strong> is considered a short-term rental. The official language from the bylaw:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Rental means a Dwelling Unit or part of a Dwelling Unit used to provide temporary accommodation for a Rental Period of not more than 29 consecutive days and shall not include a hotel, motel or Bed-and-Breakfast Establishment."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 3.0(4)(cc)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So if you're renting to guests for anything under 30 days, whether it's a weekend visitor to Canada's Wonderland or a family in town for a wedding in Kleinburg, you need to follow the STR rules. Rent for 30+ days? That's a mid-term rental and completely different rules apply.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>The 29-Day Thing Matters:</strong> Vaughan uses 29 days, Toronto uses 28, Mississauga uses 30. It sounds like splitting hairs, but it actually affects booking strategies. A 29-day stay is short-term in Vaughan but mid-term in Toronto. Keep this straight if you're managing properties across different cities.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="no-night-limit">No Annual Night Limit</h2>
          <p>This is the big one. And honestly, it's why Vaughan is more attractive for STR hosts than a lot of other GTA cities.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Vaughan Has No Annual Night Limit</h4>
            <p>While Toronto and Mississauga cap you at 180 nights per year, Vaughan has no such restriction. You can rent your principal residence 365 days a year if you want.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Think about what this means. In Toronto, once you hit 180 nights (usually by late summer), you're done for the year unless you pivot to mid-term. In Vaughan? Keep going. Peak season at Wonderland? Book it. Halloween Haunt? Book it. Holiday visitors shopping at Vaughan Mills? Book it.</p>

          <p>Of course, there's still paperwork:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Valid license (obviously)</li>
            <li>Still has to be your principal residence</li>
            <li>All other bylaw requirements still apply</li>
            <li>You're collecting and remitting that 4% MAT</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Rule</h2>
          <p>Here's where things get restrictive. Like most GTA cities, Vaughan only lets you STR your principal residence, the place where you actually live. The bylaw puts it this way:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal Residence means a dwelling unit owned or rented by an Individual Person, either alone or jointly with others, where the Individual Person is ordinarily resident."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 3.0(4)(aa)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>What does "ordinarily resident" mean in practice? It's where you sleep, where you get your mail, where you pay utilities. Your actual home, not your investment property in Woodbridge or that condo you picked up near VMC station.</p>

          <p>The property also needs to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be your <strong>principal residence</strong> (at least one applicant lives there)</li>
            <li>Be in a zone that <strong>allows residential use</strong></li>
            <li>Meet <strong>Ontario Building Code and Fire Code</strong> requirements</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Property Owners: Read This</h4>
            <p>I'll be blunt. If you bought a property in Vaughan specifically to Airbnb it, you're out of luck for short-term rentals. Second homes, vacation properties, investment condos: none of them qualify under the principal residence rule.</p>
            <p>But there's a workaround: <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">mid-term rentals</a> (30+ consecutive days) are completely exempt from these STR rules. Different market, still good money.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: The Alternative Strategy</h2>
          <p>Look, if you can't do short-term or don't want to deal with the licensing hassle, mid-term rentals are worth considering. Since Vaughan's STR rules only kick in at 29 days or less, <strong>anything 30+ days is exempt</strong>.</p>

          <h3>What Qualifies as Mid-Term?</h3>
          <p>Here's what changes when you hit that 30-day threshold:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No STR license needed</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No principal residence requirement</strong> (yes, investment properties work)</li>
            <li>Can be operated on any property you own</li>
            <li>No MAT to collect or remit</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Why Mid-Term Works Well in Vaughan</h4>
            <p>Vaughan actually has solid mid-term rental demand. We've placed tenants from all these sources:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Corporate relocations:</strong> CN has their headquarters here. KPMG, PwC, Amazon. Tons of companies with offices in Vaughan and nearby bring in workers who need housing for a few months</li>
              <li><strong>Wonderland seasonal staff:</strong> The park employs thousands during peak season and many need housing from May through October</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare workers:</strong> Mackenzie Health brings in travel nurses and specialists on 3-6 month contracts</li>
              <li><strong>Construction crews:</strong> With all the development happening in York Region, contractors need places to stay</li>
              <li><strong>New immigrants:</strong> Vaughan has a large Italian and Jewish community, and families often need a landing spot while they look for permanent housing</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>Alright, let's talk about the licensing process. It's not as bad as some cities, but there's definitely paperwork involved.</p>

          <h3>Who Can Get a License?</h3>
          <p>Not everyone qualifies. You need to be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An <strong>individual person</strong>. Corporations, LLCs, and partnerships can't get licenses. This trips up a lot of people who've structured their properties under holding companies.</li>
            <li>A <strong>Canadian permanent resident</strong></li>
            <li><strong>18 years old or older</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What You Need to Apply</h3>
          <p>The application requires quite a bit. Start gathering this stuff early:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Completed application</strong>, signed by all applicants</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership or tenancy</strong> (deed, lease, whatever applies)</li>
            <li><strong>License fee</strong> (it's non-refundable, so make sure you qualify before paying)</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Canadian PR</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Government photo ID</strong> for everyone applying</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable Sector Check</strong> (the background check, needs to be less than 90 days old)</li>
            <li><strong>Principal residence proof</strong> (utility bills, tax returns, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>List of all STR operators</strong> with contact info</li>
            <li><strong>MAT registration</strong> (you actually need to register for the accommodation tax before you can apply for the license)</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Renting Your Home?</strong> If you're a tenant wanting to STR, you need a notarized letter from your landlord explicitly allowing it. Not just a verbal okay, an actual notarized document. And honestly? Good luck getting that. Most landlords won't sign off on this.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Don't Let Your License Lapse</h3>
          <p>This is important. Your license needs to be renewed annually, and the penalties for forgetting are harsh:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Renewal opens <strong>2 months before</strong> your anniversary date</li>
            <li><strong>1-30 days late:</strong> 15% late fee</li>
            <li><strong>30-90 days late:</strong> 30% late fee</li>
            <li><strong>Over 90 days late:</strong> License cancelled. You can't reapply for 2 years. Seriously.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Set a calendar reminder. This isn't something you want to mess up.</p>

          <h2 id="background-check">Background Check Requirements</h2>
          <p>Vaughan takes background checks seriously. You'll need what's called a Vulnerable Sector Check. It's more thorough than a basic criminal record check.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A complete Vulnerable Sector Check for every Applicant, issued by an Ontario Police Service, not more than 90 days old, from the date of application."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 5.0(13)(g)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Get this from York Regional Police or your local police service. Plan ahead because these can take 2-4 weeks to process, sometimes longer. And remember, it can't be more than 90 days old when you submit your application.</p>

          <h3>What Gets You Disqualified</h3>
          <p>Certain criminal convictions within the past 5 years are automatic deal-breakers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Homicide or manslaughter</li>
            <li>Sexual offences</li>
            <li>Assault offences</li>
            <li>Confinement offences</li>
            <li>Robbery or extortion</li>
            <li>Break and enter</li>
            <li>Fraud or forgery</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I'm not going to editorialize here. Those are the rules. If any of these apply, you won't get a license.</p>

          <h2 id="property-types">What Properties Qualify?</h2>
          <p>Your STR has to be in a dwelling unit that's your principal residence. But within that constraint, there's some flexibility.</p>

          <h3>Property Types That Work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-family homes</strong> (detached houses in Maple, Woodbridge, Kleinburg, wherever)</li>
            <li><strong>Townhouses</strong> (plenty of these near Highway 7 and in Thornhill)</li>
            <li><strong>Condo units</strong>, but only if your condo corporation allows STRs (more on that below)</li>
            <li><strong>Apartments</strong> with landlord authorization (good luck with that)</li>
            <li><strong>Room rentals</strong> (you can rent part of your home while you live there)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Condo Catch</h3>
          <p>If you're in a condo or multi-unit building, the city requires proof that STRs are allowed:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "If the proposed Short-Term Rental is to be located in a Multiple Unit Dwelling, Applicants shall provide, at the time of application, a letter from the owner of such Multiple Unit Dwelling declaring that the Operation of Short-Term Rentals is permitted."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 5.0(9)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Translation: you need a letter from your condo board saying STRs are okay. No letter, no license. And here's the reality: a lot of condos, especially the newer towers near VMC station, have banned short-term rentals entirely. Check your condo rules first before you waste time on the application.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance">Compliance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Getting the license is just the start. There's ongoing stuff you need to stay on top of once you're operating.</p>

          <h3>Post Your License Visibly</h3>
          <p>Your license needs to be visible from outside the property, near the main entrance. It's not just a suggestion:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Every Short-Term Rental Owner shall post the licence supplied by the City at the time of issuance or renewal in a conspicuous place visible from the outside of the Dwelling Unit, on, or as near as possible to, the main entrance to the Short-Term Rental."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 11.0(8)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>One Booking at a Time</h3>
          <p>This catches some people off guard. You can't have overlapping bookings. No renting the basement suite to one group while another is upstairs:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Short-Term Rental Owner shall offer or accept multiple reservations where the proposed accommodation Rental Periods of said reservations overlap."
            <cite>Vaughan By-Law 158-2019, Section 11.0(2)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Pass Inspections</h3>
          <p>Your property needs to comply with Ontario Building Code and Fire Code. The city can require an inspection before they issue or renew your license. Make sure you've got working smoke detectors, CO detectors, fire extinguisher. The basics.</p>

          <h3>Use Licensed Platforms</h3>
          <p>You can only list on platforms that have a valid City of Vaughan brokerage license. Airbnb and VRBO have this covered. If you're thinking about listing on some other platform, double-check that they're licensed in Vaughan.</p>

          <h3>Keep Records for 3 Years</h3>
          <p>You need to track and keep records of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Number of nights rented</li>
            <li>Nightly and total prices</li>
            <li>Whether it was entire-unit or partial-unit</li>
            <li>MAT collected on each booking</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The city can ask for these records at any time. Keep everything organized. Spreadsheets, booking confirmations, whatever works for you.</p>

          <h2 id="why-worth-it">Why STR Is Worth It in Vaughan</h2>
          <p>After all that regulation talk, you might wonder if it's even worth it. Here's my take: Vaughan is actually one of the better GTA markets for STRs if you do it right.</p>

          <h3>The No-Night-Limit Advantage</h3>
          <p>I keep coming back to this because it's genuinely significant. Toronto and Mississauga hosts watch their calendars carefully, trying to stretch 180 nights across the year. Vaughan hosts don't have that problem. You can operate year-round and capture every peak period.</p>

          <h3>Solid Demand Drivers</h3>
          <p>Vaughan has real, consistent visitor traffic:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Canada's Wonderland:</strong> Millions of visitors from May to October, plus Halloween Haunt and Winterfest. Families want houses near the park, not downtown hotels.</li>
            <li><strong>Vaughan Mills:</strong> One of the biggest malls in the GTA. People drive from hours away to shop there, and some stay overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate visits:</strong> KPMG, PwC, CN headquarters, Amazon fulfillment. Lots of business travelers.</li>
            <li><strong>Subway access:</strong> The Line 1 extension to VMC means guests can stay in Vaughan and easily get downtown. Best of both worlds.</li>
            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Wedding venues in Kleinburg, Bellvue Manor, corporate events at various halls. Guests need somewhere to stay.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Bigger Spaces, Better Rates</h3>
          <p>Here's something people overlook: Vaughan has bigger properties than downtown Toronto. Those 4-5 bedroom detached homes in Maple or Woodbridge? They command serious premiums for groups and families. A condo downtown might get $150/night. A house near Wonderland during peak season? $400-500+ isn't unusual.</p>

          <h3>Get Help If You Need It</h3>
          <p>Real talk: managing all this compliance stuff while also handling guest communication, cleaning coordination, and dynamic pricing is a lot. It's why we started <a href="/">Nurture</a>. We handle license compliance, guest screening, turnover, pricing optimization, all of it, so you can collect rent without the day-to-day headaches. But even if you go it alone, Vaughan's market makes the effort worthwhile.</p>

          <h2 id="official-resources">Official Resources</h2>
          <p>Don't take my word for everything. Here are the official City of Vaughan sources. Bylaws change, and you want to verify the current rules before you commit.</p>
