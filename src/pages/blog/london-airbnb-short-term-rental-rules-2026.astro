const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in London?", a: "No. London requires STRs to be at your Resident Address - the place where you habitually sleep, eat, and keep personal effects. You can only have one Resident Address. Investment properties don't qualify. Consider mid-term rentals (30+ days) for investment properties." },
  { q: "How much does a London STR license cost?", a: "$196 per year, and the fee is not pro-rated. So if you get licensed in November, you still pay the full $196 and need to renew the following year. Plan your timing accordingly." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need?", a: "$2,000,000 liability insurance per occurrence that covers short-term rental operations. Standard homeowner's insurance won't suffice - you need specialized STR coverage or a rider." },
  { q: "How many bedrooms can I rent?", a: "Maximum 5 bedrooms can be offered as Short-term Accommodation. This applies regardless of how large your home is." },
  { q: "Does Airbnb collect the MAT tax?", a: "Yes. Airbnb and other major platforms are registered as Short-term Accommodation Brokers with London and collect the 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax automatically on platform bookings." },
  { q: "What if I'm a tenant, not an owner?", a: "You can still get licensed, but you need written proof that your landlord permits STR operation. If you're in a condo, you also need condo board approval. Both documents are required with your application." },
  { q: "Do I need a criminal background check?", a: "Yes. London requires a Criminal Record and Judicial Matters Check (CRJMC) dated less than 90 days before your application. This is a stricter requirement than many Ontario cities." },
  { q: "What are the fines for operating without a license?", a: "Fines start at $500 for the first offense but can reach $25,000 (individual) or $50,000 (corporation) for first offenses. Subsequent offenses can reach $50,000 individual or $100,000 corporate. Each day of violation can be a separate offense." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">London is Ontario's largest city outside the GTA, home to Western University's 40,000+ students and a growing tech sector. That creates year-round STR demand from visiting parents, academics, and professionals.</p>
            <p class="lead">The city regulates short-term rentals through Schedule 21 of their Business Licensing By-law (L.-131-16), effective October 2022. It's a comprehensive framework with strict requirements including criminal background checks. Here's everything you need to know.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>London's definition is clear and specific:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term Accommodation means a temporary accommodation in all or part of a Dwelling that is provided for 29 consecutive days or less in exchange for payment including a bed and breakfast, but not including a hotel, motel, inn, resort, hostel, lodging house or rooming house."
            <cite>London By-law L.-131-16, Schedule 21 § 1.0</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key elements of this definition:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>29 days or less</strong> - one day shorter than most Ontario cities (30 days)</li>
            <li><strong>In exchange for payment</strong> - free stays aren't regulated</li>
            <li><strong>Includes B&Bs</strong> - traditional bed and breakfasts fall under STR rules</li>
            <li><strong>Excludes commercial hospitality</strong> - hotels, motels, hostels have separate rules</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>The 29-day threshold:</strong> Unlike most Ontario cities that use 30 days, London uses 29. This means a 30-day booking is NOT an STR in London. If you want to avoid STR regulations entirely, book guests for 30+ consecutive days.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Resident Address Requirement</h2>
          <p>London takes a strict approach to ensuring STRs are in primary homes:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Resident Address means the place at which an individual habitually sleeps, eats, keeps their personal effects, and has a regular place of lodging; an individual may have only one Resident Address."
            <cite>London By-law L.-131-16, Schedule 21 § 1.0</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The application requires:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sworn declaration</strong> that the STR address is your Resident Address</li>
            <li><strong>Government-issued ID</strong> showing your Resident Address</li>
            <li><strong>Attestation</strong> that you're an individual (corporations cannot be STR providers)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Corporations Cannot Be STR Providers</h4>
            <p>London explicitly requires STR providers to be individuals, not corporations or partnerships. The by-law states the provider "does not include a corporation or partnership." If you hold property through a corporation, you cannot operate it as an STR. This is stricter than many Ontario municipalities.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>London has one of the more demanding application processes in Ontario:</p>

          <h3>Application Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sworn declaration</strong> that you're 18+, an individual, and the address is your Resident Address</li>
            <li><strong>Government-issued ID</strong> with photo showing your Resident Address</li>
            <li><strong>Criminal Record and Judicial Matters Check (CRJMC)</strong> dated within 90 days</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong> if you own the dwelling</li>
            <li><strong>Landlord permission</strong> (if you're a tenant)</li>
            <li><strong>Condo board permission</strong> (if in a condo)</li>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 liability insurance</strong> certificate</li>
            <li><strong>Signed indemnity</strong> in favor of the City</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>License Fees</h3>
          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Item</div>

            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Pro-rated?</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>No</strong></div>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>2</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Ongoing Requirements</h3>
          <p>Once licensed, you must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Display your license number</strong> on all listings and marketing materials</li>
            <li><strong>Provide local emergency contact</strong> to all guests</li>
            <li><strong>Post fire safety materials</strong> provided by London Fire Department</li>
            <li><strong>Issue receipts/invoices</strong> showing license number, prices, and MAT</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain insurance</strong> and file renewals 5 days before expiry</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="broker-rules">Platform Broker Requirements</h2>
          <p>London also licenses the platforms themselves:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term Accommodation Broker means any individual, partnership, or corporation that, for compensation, markets and brokers the booking, reservation, or rental, of a Short-term Accommodation on behalf of a Short-term Accommodation Provider by means of a website or digital application."
            <cite>London By-law L.-131-16, Schedule 21 § 1.0</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Platforms like Airbnb must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Get a Broker License</strong> from the City of London</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain $5,000,000 liability insurance</strong> (higher than host requirement)</li>
            <li><strong>Verify host license numbers</strong> before allowing listings</li>
            <li><strong>Collect and remit MAT</strong> on behalf of hosts</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Ontario address</strong> for receiving city notices</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="bedroom-limits">Bedroom Limits</h2>
          <p>London caps the size of STR operations:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "shall not offer more than five bedrooms as Short-term Accommodation"
            <cite>London By-law L.-131-16, Schedule 21 § 7.1(d)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Limit Type</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Maximum</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Bedrooms per STR</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>5</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">STRs per provider</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>2</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The 2-STR limit is interesting - it means you could potentially operate your primary home and one other unit (though the other would need to be at your Resident Address, making this practically limited).</p>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>London requires substantial coverage:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "an insurance certificate demonstrating general liability insurance for the operations of the proposed Short-term Accommodation against claims filed against the applicant with respect to bodily injury, including personal injury and death, and property damage with a per occurrence limit of at least $2,000,000"
            <cite>London By-law L.-131-16, Schedule 21 § 5.1(h)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> per occurrence</li>
            <li><strong>Must cover STR operations</strong> specifically</li>
            <li><strong>Bodily injury and property damage</strong> coverage required</li>
            <li><strong>File renewals 5 days before expiry</strong> of current policy</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additionally, you must sign an <strong>indemnity agreement</strong> in favor of the City, protecting them from claims arising from your STR operation.</p>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</h2>
          <p>London charges 4% MAT on all short-term rentals:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">MAT Details</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Information</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Tax rate</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>4%</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">On top of</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>Plus HST</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Platform bookings</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>Collected by Airbnb</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Direct bookings</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>Host collects & remits</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>For most hosts using Airbnb, the 4% MAT is collected automatically. For direct bookings, you're responsible for collecting from guests and remitting to the City.</p>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>London's penalty structure escalates significantly:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Violation Type</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Fine Range</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Minimum fine</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$500</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Individual - First offense max</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$25,000</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Individual - Subsequent offense max</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$50,000</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Corporation - First offense max</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$50,000</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Corporation - Subsequent offense max</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$100,000</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Fines double for subsequent offenses. And each day of continued violation can be treated as a separate offense, meaning penalties can accumulate rapidly.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in London</h2>
          <p>London has relatively low compliance rates (~152 licensed out of ~700 listings as of 2023). The city is increasing enforcement. Here's how to stay compliant:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Get your CRJMC early.</strong> The criminal background check must be dated within 90 days of application. Schedule it well in advance so processing delays don't hold up your license.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>License before listing.</strong> Display your license number on every listing and advertisement. Operating without a visible license number is an easy violation to prove.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Get landlord/condo approval in writing.</strong> If you don't own outright, you need documented permission. Verbal agreements won't satisfy the application requirements.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Stay under 5 bedrooms.</strong> Even if your home has 6 bedrooms, you can only rent 5 as STR. Consider keeping one as personal space.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Post fire safety materials.</strong> London Fire Department provides specific materials that must be displayed in your STR. Contact them if you haven't received them.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Issue proper receipts.</strong> Every guest should get documentation showing your license number, itemized pricing, and MAT. This is a requirement, not optional.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>File insurance renewals 5 days early.</strong> Don't let your coverage lapse. Mark your calendar for 5 days before your policy expires to file the renewal.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Consider the 30-day workaround.</strong> Bookings of 30+ consecutive days aren't STRs in London. Good for longer-term guests or slower seasons.</li>
          </ul>
