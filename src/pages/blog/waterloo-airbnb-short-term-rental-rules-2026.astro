const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Waterloo?", a: "No. Waterloo requires Short-Term Rentals to be Owner Occupied, meaning you must own at least 50% of the property and actually live there. Investment properties don't qualify. For investment properties, consider mid-term rentals (31+ days) which fall outside the STR definition and don't have the owner-occupancy requirement." },
  { q: "What's the maximum number of nights I can rent per year?", a: "275 days per calendar year. This is actually quite generous compared to Toronto's 180-night limit. But here's the catch: you also can't rent to any single guest for more than 30 consecutive days. So you need to manage bookings to stay within both limits." },
  { q: "Do I need a license for a 30-day rental?", a: "It depends. If the rental is exactly 30 days, it falls within the STR definition (30 days or less). If it's 31+ days, it's not considered a Short-Term Rental and different rules apply. The platform matters too - if you list on Airbnb even for 31+ days, it might still be classified as STR." },
  { q: "How much does a Waterloo STR license cost?", a: "License fees are set in the City's Fees and Charges By-Law and vary by class. Class B licenses (required for STRs) have their own fee structure. Contact the City's Municipal Enforcement Services at 519-747-8785 for current rates, as these change annually." },
  { q: "When does my license expire?", a: "All rental licenses in Waterloo expire on March 31st, regardless of when you applied. So if you get licensed in February, you'll be renewing just a month later. Plan your application timing accordingly to maximize your license term." },
  { q: "What if I don't live in Waterloo Region?", a: "You must designate a Local Contact - someone who lives in Waterloo Region who can manage issues related to your rental. Their contact information becomes part of your license application. Many out-of-town owners use property managers for this requirement." },
  { q: "What documents do I need for the license?", a: "Quite a list: proof of ownership, floor plan with room dimensions, parking plan compliant with zoning, property maintenance plan, police records check, $2M insurance certificate, HVAC inspection certificate, and ESA electrical inspection (for new applications). You also need a signed declaration confirming compliance with Building Code, Fire Code, and Electrical Safety Code." },
  { q: "Can I rent out more than 4 bedrooms?", a: "For a Class B license (owner-occupied STRs), no more than 50% of your gross floor area can be bedrooms, and you're limited to 4 bedrooms for rent. If you have 5+ bedrooms, you'd need a Class C license with much stricter requirements including fire code compliance for rooming houses." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Class A and Class B licenses?", a: "Class B is specifically for owner-occupied properties and includes Short-Term Rentals. Class A is for non-owner-occupied rental units but does NOT allow Short-Term Rentals. For Airbnb hosting, you need Class B, which requires you to live in the property." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Waterloo is Canada's tech hub, home to the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and over 1,500 tech startups. That means year-round demand for short-term stays from visiting professors, tech workers, and parents of 70,000+ students.</p>
            <p class="lead">The city's STR rules are baked into their broader Rental Housing Licensing By-law (2011-047, updated 2023). Unlike some cities that created standalone STR bylaws, Waterloo treats short-term rentals as a subset of their rental licensing system. Here's what you need to know.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Waterloo defines Short-Term Rentals more specifically than most Ontario cities:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Rental means all or part of a Dwelling Unit that is used to provide transient sleeping accommodations for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days or less, typically facilitated through a Short-Term Rental Platform... A Short-Term Rental must be Owner Occupied."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key elements of this definition:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>30 days or less</strong> - that's the threshold (not 28 like some cities)</li>
            <li><strong>Must be owner-occupied</strong> - it's built right into the definition</li>
            <li><strong>Typically facilitated through a platform</strong> - Airbnb, VRBO, etc. are specifically contemplated</li>
            <li><strong>Excludes hotels, inns, B&Bs</strong> - those have separate rules</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Platform matters:</strong> The bylaw specifically mentions "Short-Term Rental Platform" as "any online service, website, mobile application, or other digital platform that facilitates the rental, advertisement, or listing." If you're listing on Airbnb, you're operating an STR regardless of booking length.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="owner-occupied">The Owner-Occupied Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is the gatekeeper for Waterloo STRs. The bylaw is clear about what owner-occupied means:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Owner Occupied means occupied by persons holding at least fifty per cent (50%) of the title to the property as identified in the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services Parcel register."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So to operate an STR in Waterloo, you must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Own at least 50%</strong> of the property title</li>
            <li><strong>Actually live there</strong> - "occupied" means you're a resident</li>
            <li><strong>Be on the official land registry</strong> - your name must show on the parcel register</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Properties Don't Qualify</h4>
            <p>Unlike some cities where you can get away with creative structures, Waterloo is explicit: STRs must be owner-occupied. Investment properties, properties held in certain corporate structures, or homes where you don't actually live cannot be used for short-term rentals under 30 days. For investment properties, mid-term rentals (31+ consecutive days) are your best option.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="night-limits">The 275-Night Annual Limit</h2>
          <p>Waterloo gives you more runway than Toronto (180 nights) but less than Oakville (no limit). The rules are specific:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Class "B" licence holders operating a Short-Term Rental may only rent to any one (1) person for a maximum of thirty (30) consecutive days, and shall not operate a Short-Term Rental for more than 275 days in a calendar year."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 Schedule 2 § 8</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Rule</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Limit</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Maximum nights per year</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>275 days</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Maximum consecutive days per guest</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>30 days</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Calendar year</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">January 1 - December 31</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>That leaves 90 days per year where you can't short-term rent. Many hosts use this time for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal use during holidays and summer</li>
            <li>Maintenance and renovations</li>
            <li>Mid-term rentals (31+ days) which don't count toward the cap</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="license-classes">Understanding License Classes</h2>
          <p>Waterloo has six license classes. For STR hosts, you need to know about Class B:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Class</div>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "All Short-Term Rentals require a Class "B" licence, notwithstanding the number of Bedrooms in the Dwelling Unit."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 Schedule 2 § 8</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Class B Requirements</h3>
          <p>In addition to general licensing requirements, Class B properties must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maximum 4 bedrooms</strong> available for rent</li>
            <li><strong>No more than 50%</strong> of gross floor area can be bedrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Be owner-occupied</strong> - building must be occupied by 50%+ title holder</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum bedroom size:</strong> 14 sq m for 3 adults, or 7 sq m per adult for 4+</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="application">License Application Requirements</h2>
          <p>Waterloo requires extensive documentation. Here's the full checklist:</p>

          <h3>Documentation Required</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong> (transfer/deed)</li>
            <li><strong>Police records check</strong> for owner (and all partners/directors if corporate)</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing all rooms with dimensions in square metres, identifying bedrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Parking plan</strong> compliant with Zoning By-law, showing all parking spaces and dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Property maintenance plan</strong> covering compliance with Property Standards, snow removal, garbage/recycling locations</li>
            <li><strong>HVAC inspection certificate</strong> from certified technician</li>
            <li><strong>ESA electrical inspection</strong> (for initial applications, within past 6 months)</li>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 liability insurance</strong> identifying STR operation</li>
            <li><strong>Signed declaration</strong> confirming compliance with Building Code, Fire Code, Electrical Safety Code</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The information or documentation referred to in sections 1(i), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l) and 1(p) of this Schedule shall only be required for the issuance of any Class of licence, not a renewal, except for every fifth renewal (meaning every five (5) years)."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 Schedule 6 § 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Good news: some documents (police check, parking plan, floor plan, maintenance plan, electrical inspection) are only required for initial applications and every 5 years on renewal.</p>

          <h3>License Term</h3>
          <p>All Waterloo rental licenses expire on <strong>March 31st annually</strong>, regardless of when you applied. Apply in February and you'll be renewing a month later. Plan accordingly.</p>

          <h3>Ongoing Requirements</h3>
          <p>Once licensed, you must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Post license visibly</strong> in the rental unit along with floor plan</li>
            <li><strong>Produce license on demand</strong> for Municipal Law Enforcement Officers</li>
            <li><strong>Notify the Director</strong> in writing within 14 days of any changes to your application info</li>
            <li><strong>Attend a training session</strong> (online or in-person) as required by the Director</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="local-contact">The Local Contact Requirement</h2>
          <p>If you don't live in Waterloo Region, you need someone local who can handle issues:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Local Contact means an agent or representative of an Owner who does not reside in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, who is responsible for managing or addressing issues in relation to the Owner's Rental Unit."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 § 1.0 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Your Local Contact's information must be included in your license application. This person handles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guest issues and complaints</li>
            <li>Property emergencies</li>
            <li>Communication with bylaw officers</li>
            <li>Any matters the city needs to address with an owner</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Waterloo requires substantial coverage:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Proof of insurance which: (i) includes a liability limit of no less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence for property damage and bodily injury; and, (ii) identifies that a Residential Rental Business is being operated on the property."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 Schedule 6 § 1(n)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> per occurrence</li>
            <li><strong>Must identify</strong> that a rental business operates on the property</li>
            <li><strong>Standard homeowner's insurance won't suffice</strong> - you need rental-specific coverage</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Waterloo doesn't mess around with enforcement:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Violation Type</div>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>Up to $100,000</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Daily continuing offense</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>$350 - $10,000/day</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Even worse, the court can order your property closed for up to 2 years if you're convicted of operating without a license.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Where an Owner is convicted of knowingly carrying on or engaging in a trade, business or occupation on, in or in respect of any premises...without a licence required by this by-law, the Court may order that the premises or part of the premises be closed to any use for a period not exceeding two (2) years."
            <cite>Waterloo By-law 2011-047 § 13.5</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Waterloo</h2>
          <p>The university towns have high enforcement due to chronic student housing issues. Here's how to stay on the right side:</p>

            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Track your nights carefully.</strong> You have 275 days to work with. Use a calendar or property management software to track every booking. Airbnb reports to municipalities now, so the city can verify.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Watch the 30-day guest limit.</strong> No single guest can stay more than 30 consecutive days. If someone wants to extend, they technically need to check out and rebook.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Keep your license posted.</strong> It must be displayed "in a conspicuous place in the Rental Unit" along with your floor plan. Failing to produce it on demand is a violation.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Update the city within 14 days.</strong> Any changes to your ownership, contact info, or property must be reported. This includes changes to your Local Contact.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Renew before March 31st.</strong> Don't let your license lapse. Operating without a valid license is the easiest violation to catch and prosecute.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Maintain 4 or fewer bedrooms.</strong> Go above 4 and you're in Class C territory with fire code requirements for rooming houses. It's a completely different compliance world.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Don't fake owner-occupancy.</strong> The city can verify through land registry records. Getting caught with false documentation can mean license revocation and prosecution.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Consider mid-term for flexibility.</strong> Bookings of 31+ consecutive days don't count toward your 275-night cap and have fewer restrictions. Good for off-peak seasons.</li>
