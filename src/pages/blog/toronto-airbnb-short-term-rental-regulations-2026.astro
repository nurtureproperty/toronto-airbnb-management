const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I rent my Airbnb for more than 180 nights?", a: "Yep, and there are two legit ways to do it. You can register for partial-unit rentals (renting rooms while you're home) which has no night cap at all. Or you can switch to mid-term rentals of 28+ days, which aren't even considered short-term rentals under the bylaw. We've had clients in Liberty Village combine both strategies to rent year-round." },
  { q: "Does the limit reset at the start of each year?", a: "It does. The 180-night count runs January 1st to December 31st, then you're back to zero. But here's what catches people: you need to track nights across ALL platforms combined. Airbnb, VRBO, direct bookings. They all count toward your total." },
  { q: "Can I switch between entire-unit and partial-unit registration?", a: "Not without some hassle. When you register, you pick one or the other. Want to switch? You'll need to apply for a whole new registration. So think carefully about which one makes sense for your situation before you commit." },
  { q: "What qualifies as a mid-term rental?", a: "Any booking of 28 consecutive days or more. That's the magic number. These rentals don't need STR registration, aren't subject to the 180-night cap, and here's the big one: they don't require principal residence status. It's basically a different category entirely." },
  { q: "Can I do mid-term rentals on my investment property?", a: "Yes, and this is honestly the best option for most investment property owners in Toronto. Since 28+ day rentals aren't classified as short-term rentals, the principal residence rule doesn't apply. We manage several investment condos near the Financial District this way." },
  { q: "Do Toronto's rules apply to Mississauga or Brampton?", a: "Nope. Toronto's bylaws stop at the city limits. Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham. They've all got their own rules. Some are stricter, some are more relaxed. Don't assume what works in one city applies to another." },
  { q: "Is Airbnb still worth it with all these restrictions?", a: "100%. Even capped at 180 nights, most of our hosts earn 30-100% more than they would with a long-term tenant. Plus you can fill the remaining months with mid-term rentals. A 1-bedroom in King West typically pulls $3,500-4,500/month short-term versus $2,400 long-term." },
  { q: "Can I rent my basement apartment on Airbnb?", a: "Yes, as long as it's your principal residence. The city allows STRs in basement suites, laneway houses, and garden suites. We've got hosts in the Beaches and High Park areas doing exactly this with their basement units." },
  { q: "What records do I need to keep?", a: "Keep everything for at least 3 years: booking confirmations, guest contact info, dates, and proof that your registration number was on every listing. The city does audit hosts, and you don't want to be scrambling for records when they come knocking." }

          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Look, Toronto's short-term rental rules aren't as scary as people make them out to be. Yes, there's a <strong>180-night annual limit</strong> for entire home rentals. But here's what most hosts don't realize: there are completely legal ways to rent year-round if you know the bylaws.</p>
            <p class="lead">I've been helping hosts in the GTA navigate these regulations since the city introduced them, and I've seen too many people leave money on the table because they didn't understand their options. Let's break this down.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-limit">What is the 180-Night Limit?</h2>
          <p>Let's start with the rule everyone talks about. Toronto's Municipal Code Chapter 547 says:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No operator who holds a registration to operate an entire-unit rental shall rent a property for more than 180 nights per calendar year."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-4.1.1.D</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Here's the thing: this only applies to <strong>entire-unit rentals</strong>. That's when guests have your whole place to themselves while you're away. The 180 nights run from January 1st to December 31st, and every night counts whether it's booked through Airbnb, VRBO, or your cousin's friend who found you on Facebook.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>This is the part most people miss:</strong> The 180-night cap only hits entire-unit rentals. If you're renting rooms while you stay home (partial-unit), there's <strong>no limit whatsoever</strong>. You could rent 365 nights a year. It's right there in the bylaw, but somehow it doesn't get the same attention.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="partial-unit">Partial-Unit Rentals: The No-Limit Option</h2>
          <p>So what's the difference between entire-unit and partial-unit? It's simpler than you'd think:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Entire-Unit Rental</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Partial-Unit Rental</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Guests occupy the entire dwelling</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Guests occupy part of dwelling while you're home</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">180 nights per year maximum</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>NO night limit</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">You leave during guest stays</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">You must remain in the property</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Higher nightly rates typically</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Year-round income potential</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>What Qualifies as a Partial-Unit Rental?</h3>
          <p>The bylaw puts it in legalese, but basically:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Partial-unit rental means a short-term rental in which a renter occupies part of a dwelling unit...while the dwelling unit is also occupied by the operator or a member of the operator's household."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>In plain English? You're home while guests are there. That's it. Some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Renting your spare bedroom</strong> in your Leslieville semi while you sleep down the hall</li>
            <li><strong>Renting your basement room</strong> while you live upstairs in Bloor West Village</li>
            <li><strong>Renting multiple rooms</strong> to different guests, as long as you're on-site</li>
            <li>Your spouse or kid can be the one home instead of you. They count as "household members"</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="success-box">
            <h4>Why Partial-Unit Actually Works Well:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Rent all 365 nights, legally, no tricks</li>
              <li>Guests often leave better reviews when you're around to help them</li>
              <li>Insurance can be simpler (you're home, so less risk)</li>
              <li>Problems get solved immediately, not via text at 2am</li>
              <li>I've seen hosts in Parkdale and Riverdale do incredibly well with this model</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Want the full details?</strong> Read our <a href="/blog/toronto-airbnb-partial-unit-registration-guide-2026" style="color: #276749; text-decoration: underline;">complete guide to partial-unit registration</a> for requirements, step-by-step registration process, and income potential.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Pick Your Registration Carefully</h3>
          <p>When you register with the city, you have to choose: entire-unit or partial-unit. And honestly, this decision matters more than most people think.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "An application for registration shall...state whether the short-term rental is to be operated as an entire-unit rental or a partial-unit rental."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-3.1.1.C</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Here's the annoying part: you can't just flip between them whenever you want. Once you pick, you're locked in. Want to switch? New registration. So think about your actual lifestyle before committing. Can you realistically stay home during rentals? If not, entire-unit makes more sense even with the cap.</p>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: The Loophole That Isn't a Loophole</h2>
          <p>Okay, this is where things get interesting. <strong>Mid-term rentals completely bypass Toronto's STR rules.</strong> It's not a grey area or a workaround. The bylaw simply doesn't apply to rentals of 28+ days.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term rental means the use of all or part of a dwelling unit...for a rental period of less than 28 consecutive days."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>What This Actually Means for Your Rental</h3>
          <p>Book someone for 28 days or longer, and suddenly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It <strong>doesn't count</strong> toward your 180-night cap, at all</li>
            <li>You <strong>don't need</strong> that STR registration</li>
            <li>The principal residence rule? <strong>Doesn't apply</strong></li>
            <li>That 8.5% MAT tax? <strong>You don't pay it</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>The Strategy Smart Toronto Hosts Are Using</h4>
            <p>This isn't theoretical. We've got clients doing this right now:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>May through October:</strong> Short-term Airbnb at premium rates. TIFF, Pride, Caribana, Blue Jays games. These months are gold for nightly bookings in downtown Toronto.</li>
              <li><strong>November through April:</strong> Switch to 28+ day rentals. Traveling nurses at Mount Sinai, consultants on Bay Street projects, international students waiting for their U of T dorms. There's serious demand.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You hit 180 nights of STR during high season when rates are best, then fill the rest with mid-term. No gaps, no violations, maximum revenue.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Where to Find Mid-Term Guests</h3>
          <p>A few platforms that actually work here in Toronto:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: just set your minimum stay to 28 nights. Their monthly discount feature helps too.</li>
            <li><strong>Furnished Finder</strong>: huge with traveling nurses. Toronto's hospitals (Sick Kids, UHN, Sunnybrook) bring a constant stream of healthcare workers.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate housing requests</strong>: companies relocating employees to the Financial District often need 1-3 month stays</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong>: surprisingly active for furnished monthly rentals in Toronto</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="geographic-scope">Which Cities Are Actually Covered?</h2>
          <p>I get this question all the time: "Do these rules apply to my place in Mississauga?" Nope. <strong>Toronto's bylaws stop at the city limits.</strong> Everything else is a different municipality with different rules.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card toronto">
              <h4>City of Toronto (Covered)</h4>
              <p>These areas fall under Toronto's bylaws:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Downtown Toronto</li>
                <li>North York</li>
                <li>Scarborough</li>
                <li>Etobicoke</li>
                <li>East York</li>
                <li>York</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card other">
              <h4>NOT Toronto (Separate Rules)</h4>
              <p>These have their own STR regulations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mississauga</li>
                <li>Brampton</li>
                <li>Vaughan</li>
                <li>Markham</li>
                <li>Richmond Hill</li>
                <li>Oakville</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>And the rules vary wildly. Quick rundown of nearby cities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mississauga</strong>: 180-day cap, principal residence required, license is around $283/year</li>
            <li><strong>Brampton</strong>: Same 180-day limit, principal residence only, max 3 bedrooms for room rentals</li>
            <li><strong>Vaughan</strong>: Interesting one. Principal residence and license required, but no annual night limit</li>
            <li><strong>Markham</strong>: Basically a no-go. STRs under 30 days aren't really allowed</li>
            <li><strong>Richmond Hill</strong>: Currently unregulated, but they're looking at it</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Bottom line: check your actual city's rules before assuming anything. A condo in Etobicoke and one in Mississauga might be 15 minutes apart but have totally different regulations.</p>

          <h2 id="registration">Getting Registered in Toronto</h2>
          <p>Can't legally operate without registering with the city. Here's what you'll need:</p>

          <h3>The Registration Checklist</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Principal residence proof</strong> (driver's license, tax return, utility bills). They want to confirm you actually live there.</li>
            <li><strong>Your rental type</strong> (entire-unit or partial-unit). Pick one.</li>
            <li><strong>Property address</strong> (has to match your principal residence docs)</li>
            <li><strong>Contact info</strong> so the city can reach you if there's an issue (or a complaint)</li>
            <li><strong>Registration fee</strong> (around $50/year). Not bad, honestly.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>The Principal Residence Thing</h3>
          <p>This trips people up. Here's the official definition:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal residence means the dwelling unit where an operator ordinarily resides and shall not include more than one dwelling unit."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Translation: it's where you actually live. Not where you'd like to live. Not your "investment." Your actual home. The place your mail goes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You get <strong>one</strong> principal residence for STR purposes. One.</li>
            <li>That investment condo in CityPlace? Doesn't count.</li>
            <li>Your cottage in Muskoka? Nope. (Muskoka has its own rules anyway.)</li>
            <li>Owning a property isn't enough. You have to live there</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Good News About Secondary Suites</h3>
          <p>If you live in a basement apartment, laneway house, or garden suite, you can still register. The bylaw explicitly says so:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "For greater certainty, a secondary suite...or a laneway suite...or a garden suite...may be an operator's principal residence."
            <cite>Toronto Municipal Code § 547-1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So if your principal residence is a basement suite in the Annex, you can STR it. That's actually pretty fair, in my opinion.</p>

          <h2 id="what-qualifies">What Properties Can You Actually STR?</h2>
          <p>Assuming it's your principal residence, these property types work:</p>

          <h3>You're Good With:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Single-family homes (common in places like Beaches, Riverdale)</li>
            <li>Semi-detached houses (typical in Trinity Bellwoods, Leslieville)</li>
            <li>Townhouses</li>
            <li>Condo units (with a big caveat below)</li>
            <li>Apartments (if your landlord allows it)</li>
            <li>Basement suites</li>
            <li>Laneway houses</li>
            <li>Garden suites</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Condo Problem</h4>
            <p>Here's where it gets messy. Even if the city says you can STR your condo, <strong>your condo board can say no</strong>. And many do. I've seen hosts get registered with the city, list their place, then get a cease and desist from their condo corporation. Super frustrating. Check your condo's declaration, rules, and bylaws BEFORE you do anything else. Seriously. I can't stress this enough.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">The 8.5% MAT Tax (Yeah, It's High)</h2>
          <p>Toronto's <strong>Municipal Accommodation Tax</strong> is 8.5%. That's one of the highest in Ontario. Mississauga and Brampton are at 4%, for comparison.</p>

          <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>8.5%</strong> gets added on top of your nightly rate</li>
            <li><strong>Airbnb and VRBO collect it automatically</strong>, so you don't have to do anything</li>
            <li><strong>Only applies to stays under 28 days</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mid-term rentals (28+ days)?</strong> No MAT. Another reason that strategy works.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The good news: if you're using major platforms, they handle the collection and remittance. You won't even touch the money. Just know that your guests are paying 8.5% on top of what you're charging, so factor that into your pricing. A $200/night stay actually costs your guest $217.</p>

          <h2 id="why-worth-it">Is Airbnb Still Worth It in Toronto?</h2>
          <p>With all these rules, some people ask if it's even worth bothering. My honest answer? <strong>Absolutely yes.</strong> Here's the math:</p>

          <h3>The Numbers Don't Lie</h3>
          <p>Even limited to 180 nights, most hosts come out way ahead compared to traditional leasing:</p>

          <div class="comparison-example">
            <h4>Real Example: 1-Bedroom Near King West</h4>
            <div class="example-grid">
              <div class="example-item">
                <span class="label">Long-term tenant</span>
                <span class="value">$2,400/month</span>
                <span class="annual">$28,800/year</span>
              </div>
              <div class="example-item highlight">
                <span class="label">Airbnb (180 nights @ $200/night)</span>
                <span class="value">$36,000/year</span>
                <span class="annual">+25% more income</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="example-note">And that's just the 180 nights. Fill the remaining 185 days with mid-term rentals at $3,000/month, and you're looking at $54,000+ annually. That's nearly double a long-term lease.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>You Keep Control of Your Property</h3>
          <p>This is honestly underrated. With a long-term tenant, you're locked in for a year minimum. With short-term:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Need your place for the holidays?</strong> Just block those dates.</li>
            <li><strong>TIFF weekend?</strong> Triple your rates. People will pay.</li>
            <li><strong>Bad feeling about a booking request?</strong> Decline it. No explanation needed.</li>
            <li><strong>No eviction nightmares:</strong> Guests leave in a few days, not after months of LTB hearings</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Hybrid Approach Really Works</h3>
          <p>I keep coming back to this because it's the smartest play for most Toronto hosts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>180 nights of premium STR</strong> during high season when tourists are paying top dollar</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-term rentals (28+ days)</strong> during slower months when nightly demand drops</li>
            <li><strong>Block time for yourself</strong> when you want to actually use your home</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You're not leaving money on the table either way.</p>

          <h3>Toronto's Tourism Is Only Growing</h3>
          <p>TIFF, Pride, Caribana, Raptors games, Blue Jays, concerts at Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena... Toronto's calendar is packed. Add business travel to the Financial District and convention visitors, and there's consistent demand year-round. The 180-night cap is a constraint, not a death sentence.</p>

          <h3>You Don't Have to Do It All Yourself</h3>
          <p>Look, if tracking nights, managing guests, and worrying about compliance sounds exhausting, it doesn't have to be your problem. That's literally what we do. Property managers handle the regulations, the cleaning, the guest communication, all of it. You collect monthly payments without the headaches.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">How to Stay Out of Trouble</h2>
          <p>These are the things that trip hosts up. Don't be one of them:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Track every single night.</strong> Use a spreadsheet, use software, whatever works. But don't rely on memory. I've seen hosts hit 185 nights without realizing it because they lost track across platforms.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Put your registration number everywhere.</strong> Every listing, every platform, every ad. The city checks. It's not optional.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Keep records for 3 years minimum.</strong> Booking confirmations, guest info, payment records. When the city audits (and they do), you'll be glad you kept everything.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Plan ahead when you're getting close to 180.</strong> Around night 150, start thinking about switching to 28+ day bookings. Don't wait until you're at 175 and scrambling.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Seriously consider partial-unit if it fits your life.</strong> No night limit at all. It's worth the trade-off of being home during stays for some people.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Check condo rules FIRST.</strong> Before you register, before you list, before you do anything. A condo ban trumps city approval every time.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Regulations change.</strong> What's true today might not be true in 2027. Keep an eye on city announcements.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Consider outsourcing the hassle.</strong> Property managers deal with this stuff daily. If compliance stress is killing the appeal, hand it off.</li>
          </ul>
