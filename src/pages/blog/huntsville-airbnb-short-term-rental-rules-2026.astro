const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb a cottage I just bought in Huntsville?", a: "Not immediately. Huntsville requires you to own the property for at least 12 consecutive months before applying for an STR license. This prevents speculative buying for STR purposes and ensures owners understand their property before renting it." },
  { q: "What's the maximum number of guests I can host?", a: "Maximum 10 occupants, with no more than 2 persons per guest room. So if you have 4 bedrooms for guests, you can host up to 8 people in those rooms, plus potentially 2 more in another sleeping area, up to the 10-person cap." },
  { q: "How quickly do I need to respond to problems?", a: "Your designated Responsible Person must be contactable within 30 minutes and able to attend the property in person within 60 minutes if needed. They must be available 24/7 during guest stays." },
  { q: "What's the 3-strike rule?", a: "If you receive 3 or more violations within a rolling 2-year period, your license can be revoked. This is stricter than many Ontario municipalities that use demerit point systems. One serious violation pattern can end your STR operation." },
  { q: "Can I rent my secondary suite?", a: "No. Huntsville specifically prohibits using additional residential units (secondary suites, accessory apartments) for short-term rentals. This preserves them for long-term housing. Only your principal dwelling can be an STR." },
  { q: "When does my license expire?", a: "All STR licenses expire on December 31st each year, regardless of when you applied. If you get licensed in November, you'll need to renew by December 31st. No pro-rating - plan accordingly." },
  { q: "What about B&Bs in Huntsville?", a: "Bed and Breakfasts are a separate category with their own rules. B&Bs can have maximum 2 guest rooms, and the operator must reside on-site. If you want more than 2 guest rooms, you need an STR license." },
  { q: "What are the fines for violations?", a: "Up to $25,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations per offense. Plus, 3 violations in 2 years means automatic license revocation. The Town takes enforcement seriously in cottage country." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Huntsville is the gateway to Algonquin Park and one of Muskoka's most popular cottage destinations. Summer weekends see thousands of visitors, and the demand for short-term rentals is strong year-round.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Town implemented comprehensive STR regulations through By-law 2025-19, with a focus on protecting neighborhood character and preserving long-term housing. It includes some unique requirements like a 12-month ownership period before licensing. Here's the complete breakdown.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Huntsville distinguishes between STRs and Bed & Breakfasts:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Rental means the use of a dwelling or portion thereof that operates or offers a place of temporary residence, lodging, or occupancy by way of concession, permit, lease, license, rental agreement, or similar commercial arrangement."
            <cite>Huntsville By-law 2025-19 § Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key distinctions in Huntsville:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>STR:</strong> Can rent the entire home or rooms, no limit on guest rooms</li>
            <li><strong>B&B:</strong> Maximum 2 guest rooms, operator must live on-site</li>
            <li><strong>Both require licenses</strong> but have different requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Hotels, motels, inns</strong> have separate commercial regulations</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>B&B vs STR:</strong> If you want to rent just 1-2 rooms while living on-site, a B&B license may be simpler. For 3+ guest rooms or whole-home rentals, you need an STR license.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="ownership-requirement">The 12-Month Ownership Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is one of Huntsville's most distinctive rules:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No person shall apply for a Short-Term Rental licence unless they have owned the property for a minimum of twelve (12) consecutive months prior to the application."
            <cite>Huntsville By-law 2025-19</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The purpose is clear: prevent speculative buying of cottages purely for STR income. You must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Own for 12 full months</strong> before even applying</li>
            <li><strong>Be on title</strong> - not just a beneficial owner</li>
            <li><strong>No exceptions</strong> for inherited properties (the clock starts when you take title)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Planning to Buy and Rent?</h4>
            <p>If you're purchasing a cottage with plans to STR it, budget for 12 months of ownership costs before you can generate rental income. This includes property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and mortgage payments without rental revenue to offset them.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>Huntsville's application process includes several requirements:</p>

          <h3>Application Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong> for at least 12 consecutive months</li>
            <li><strong>Designated Responsible Person</strong> with contact information</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing sleeping areas</li>
            <li><strong>Site plan</strong> showing parking</li>
            <li><strong>Septic system compliance</strong> documentation</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance</strong> covering STR activities</li>
            <li><strong>Safety compliance</strong> (smoke/CO detectors)</li>
          </ul>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="responsible-person">Responsible Person Requirement</h2>
          <p>Every Huntsville STR must have a designated Responsible Person:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The Responsible Person must be contactable within thirty (30) minutes and able to attend the property within sixty (60) minutes if required."
            <cite>Huntsville By-law 2025-19</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The Responsible Person must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Be reachable 24/7</strong> during any guest stay</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to contact</strong> within 30 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Arrive on-site</strong> within 60 minutes if needed</li>
            <li><strong>Handle noise complaints</strong> and other issues</li>
            <li><strong>Liaise with Town officials</strong> and neighbors</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

              <strong>Property managers qualify:</strong> You can designate a professional property manager as your Responsible Person. They just need to meet the contact and response time requirements. This is common for out-of-town cottage owners.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="occupancy-limits">Guest Limits</h2>
          <p>Huntsville enforces strict occupancy rules:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Limit Type</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Maximum</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Total occupants</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>10 persons</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Per guest room</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>2 persons</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The 2-per-room rule is enforced regardless of room size. A large master bedroom still counts as 2 people maximum. This limits how many guests you can host based on your bedroom count.</p>

          <h2 id="secondary-units">Secondary Unit Prohibition</h2>
          <p>Huntsville takes a firm stance on additional residential units:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Additional residential units, including secondary suites and accessory apartments, shall not be permitted for use as Short-Term Rentals."
            <cite>Huntsville By-law 2025-19</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basement apartments</strong> cannot be STRs</li>
            <li><strong>Laneway houses/coach houses</strong> cannot be STRs</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary suites</strong> are preserved for long-term rental</li>
            <li><strong>Only the principal dwelling</strong> can be licensed for STR</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Protecting Long-Term Housing</h4>
            <p>This rule exists to preserve affordable housing stock in Huntsville. Secondary units are valuable for local workers and families. The Town prioritizes these for long-term residents over tourist accommodation.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="three-strikes">The 3-Strike Revocation Rule</h2>
          <p>Huntsville uses a straightforward violation system:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Three (3) or more violations within a rolling two (2) year period shall result in licence revocation."
            <cite>Huntsville By-law 2025-19</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>How it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Each violation counts</strong> - noise, occupancy, safety, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling 2-year window</strong> - not calendar years</li>
            <li><strong>3 strikes = revocation</strong> - not suspension, revocation</li>
            <li><strong>Can reapply</strong> but history is considered</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Town has a 24-hour complaint hotline, and neighbors do use it. Cottage country communities are tight-knit - repeated complaints get noticed.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Huntsville</h2>
          <p>Cottage country has high expectations for STR operators. Here's how to succeed:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Wait out the 12 months.</strong> Don't try to list before you've owned for a full year. The Town verifies ownership dates, and operating without a license is a serious violation.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Choose your Responsible Person carefully.</strong> They need to actually be available 24/7 and within 60 minutes of the property. A friend who "can probably make it" isn't enough.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Enforce occupancy limits strictly.</strong> Set clear house rules, use security cameras (exterior only), and screen guests. A group of 15 will get reported by neighbors.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Don't rent the secondary suite.</strong> If your cottage has a basement apartment or bunkie, it cannot be part of your STR. Keep it for personal use or long-term rental.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Communicate quiet hours.</strong> Most complaints are noise-related. Make 10 PM quiet hours part of your house rules and follow up with guests.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Track your violations.</strong> With 3 strikes and you're out, you need to know where you stand. Keep records of any municipal communications.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Renew before December 31st.</strong> All licenses expire at year-end. Don't let yours lapse - operating without a valid license counts as a violation.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Build neighbor relationships.</strong> Introduce yourself to neighbors, give them your contact info, and address concerns before they become official complaints.</li>
          </ul>
