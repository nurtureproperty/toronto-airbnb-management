const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Burlington?", a: "No. Burlington requires the property to be your principal residence. You must actually live there and have it listed as your primary address on your income tax return. Investment properties, second homes, and cottages don't qualify. Mid-term rentals (29+ days) are an alternative for investment properties since they fall outside the STR definition." },
  { q: "What is the night limit in Burlington?", a: "Burlington allows a maximum of 183 nights per year for short-term rentals. This is slightly more generous than Toronto's 180-night limit. Remember, each stay must also be 28 consecutive days or less to count as an STR." },
  { q: "How much does a Burlington STR license cost?", a: "The license fee is set by Burlington's Rates and Fees By-law 61-2021. Contact the City's licensing department for current rates. The license is valid for one year from the date of issuance, not a fixed calendar date like some other municipalities." },
  { q: "What happens if I get too many demerit points?", a: "At 7 points, your license can be suspended for up to 6 months. At 15 points, it can be revoked entirely. Points remain on your record for 2 years from the date assessed. One fire code violation with a fine is 7 points alone, enough for immediate suspension." },
  { q: "Do I need to be available 24/7 to respond to issues?", a: "Yes. Burlington requires a Local Contact who can physically attend the property within one hour of being contacted by phone or email, at any time. If you don't live in Burlington, you must designate someone local. Many hosts use property managers to satisfy this requirement." },
  { q: "What's the maximum occupancy for my STR?", a: "Burlington limits occupancy to 2 adults per legal bedroom. This is based on bedrooms that meet Building Code and Fire Code requirements. You can't simply add extra mattresses or convert non-bedroom spaces to increase capacity." },
  { q: "What documents do I need for the license application?", a: "Quite a lot: proof of ownership or landlord consent, floor plan with room dimensions in square metres, parking management plan, property maintenance plan, Renter's Code, $2M insurance certificate, criminal reference check (less than 30 days old), HVAC inspection certificate, ESA electrical inspection (initial applications only, within past 6 months), and a sworn declaration of compliance." },
  { q: "Can I operate an STR in my condo?", a: "Even if you get licensed by the City, your condo corporation can prohibit short-term rentals in their declaration or rules. Many Burlington condos have restrictions. Check your condo documents before investing time in the license application. The City's approval doesn't override private condo rules." },
  { q: "What's the Renter's Code requirement?", a: "You must create a document (approved by the Licensing Administrator) that explains guest responsibilities, behavioural expectations, noise rules, parking rules, and relevant bylaws. Every guest must receive it, and you keep confirmation of receipt for at least one year." },
  { q: "When did Burlington's STR regulations take effect?", a: "Burlington's Short-Term Accommodation By-law 01-2025 came into force on May 1, 2025. Before this, Burlington was one of the few GTA cities without STR-specific regulations. Now it has comprehensive licensing similar to Oakville and other regulated cities." }

          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Burlington was one of the last GTA cities without short-term rental regulations. That changed on <strong>May 1, 2025</strong>, when By-law 01-2025 took effect. If you've been operating an Airbnb in Burlington without a license, you now need to get compliant.</p>
            <p class="lead">The new rules are comprehensive. Burlington adopted a <strong>demerit point system</strong> similar to Oakville's, requires <strong>principal residence status</strong>, and caps rentals at <strong>183 nights per year</strong>. Here's everything you need to know.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Burlington's By-law 01-2025 defines short-term accommodation precisely:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term accommodation or STA means the provision of a dwelling unit which is used for the temporary lodging of the travelling public for a rental period of not greater than 28 consecutive days to a maximum of 183 days per year in exchange for payment."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 § 1.1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Two key numbers to remember:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>28 days maximum per stay</strong>: Any single booking must be 28 consecutive days or less</li>
            <li><strong>183 days maximum per year</strong>: Your total rental nights can't exceed 183 in a calendar year</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you book a guest for 29+ days, it's considered a mid-term rental and falls outside STR regulations. This is an important distinction because mid-term rentals don't require principal residence status.</p>

            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>

            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Comparison with nearby cities:</strong> Burlington's 183-night limit is slightly more generous than Toronto (180 nights) and Mississauga (180 days). However, <a href="/blog/oakville-airbnb-short-term-rental-rules-2026">Oakville has no annual night limit</a> at all for licensed STRs.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is the rule that affects investment property owners most. Burlington requires STRs to be operated from your principal residence:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal residence means a property that is owned or rented alone or jointly with another person, where the person(s) is ordinarily a resident and has designated the property as their principal residence on their income tax filing and in other government records."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 § 1.1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This isn't just about ownership. You need to actually live there and have the documentation to prove it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income tax return</strong> listing it as your principal residence</li>
            <li><strong>Government records</strong> (driver's license, health card) showing this address</li>
            <li><strong>Actual residency</strong>: You must "ordinarily reside" there</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Property Owners</h4>
            <p>You cannot operate a short-term rental on a property that isn't your principal residence. Period. For investment properties in Burlington, your best option is mid-term rentals (29+ consecutive days), which fall outside STR regulations and don't require principal residence status.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="night-limit">The 183-Night Annual Limit</h2>
          <p>Unlike Oakville (which has no night limit) or Hamilton (also no limit), Burlington caps your STR at <strong>183 nights per calendar year</strong>. This is built into the definition of what constitutes an STR in Burlington.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The 183-night limit means you can operate for roughly half the year. For many hosts, this is sufficient for peak season rental income while maintaining the property for personal use.</p>

          <h2 id="demerit-system">The Demerit Point System</h2>
          <p>Burlington adopted a demerit point system similar to Oakville's. Every violation adds points to your license, and accumulate too many and you lose your ability to operate.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>How Points Are Assessed</h3>
          <p>Points aren't automatic. They're triggered when violations are confirmed through orders, fines, or administrative penalties. A confirmed order results in fewer points than a provincial offence notice or administrative penalty.</p>

            <h4>How Fast Points Add Up</h4>
            <p>Here's a scenario: Your guest throws a loud party. Neighbours call bylaw.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Noise violation with fine:</strong> 5 points</li>
              <li><strong>Parking violations (cars on lawn):</strong> 3 points</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's <strong>8 points from one incident</strong>, enough for license suspension. Those points stay for 2 years. This is why guest vetting and clear house rules are critical in Burlington.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Application Requirements</h2>
          <p>Burlington's application requirements are thorough. Here's the complete checklist from Schedule 1 of the bylaw:</p>

          <h3>Documentation Checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Completed application form</strong> with owner/applicant contact details</li>
            <li><strong>Applicable licensing fee</strong> (per Rates and Fees By-law 61-2021)</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of age</strong>: Must be at least 18 years old</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong> (transfer/deed) or written landlord consent if renting</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing all rooms with dimensions in square metres, identifying lodging units</li>
            <li><strong>Parking Management Plan</strong> compliant with zoning bylaw, showing parking space locations and dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Property Maintenance Plan</strong> covering garbage/recycling locations, snow storage, and responsible party</li>
            <li><strong>Renter's Code</strong> (approved by Licensing Administrator)</li>
            <li><strong>Criminal Reference Check</strong>: Must be less than 30 days old at application time</li>
            <li><strong>HVAC inspection certificate</strong> from certified technician</li>
            <li><strong>ESA electrical inspection</strong> (initial applications only, within past 6 months)</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance certificate</strong> ($2M liability, must notify City of cancellation)</li>
            <li><strong>Sworn declaration</strong> confirming compliance with Building Code, Fire Code, Electrical Safety Code, and principal residence status</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A completed application for a licence or for renewal of a licence shall be submitted to the Licensing Administrator accompanied by the requirements prescribed in Schedule 1, and any other information that the Licensing Administrator may from time to time request."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 § 5.1</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>License Term</h3>
          <p>Burlington licenses expire <strong>one year from the date of issuance</strong>. Unlike Oakville (which uses a fixed October 31st expiry), your renewal date depends on when you originally applied.</p>

          <h2 id="local-contact">The Local Contact Requirement</h2>
          <p>If you don't live in Burlington, you must designate a Local Contact. Even if you do live locally, having backup is wise.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Local contact means an agent or representative of an Owner who does not reside in the City of Burlington is responsible for managing or addressing issues in relation to the Owner's Short-Term Accommodation."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 § 1.1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The key requirement:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Ensure that there is a Local Contact available to attend to the STA at all times within a period of no greater than one hour from the time of contact by way of telephone or e-mail."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 Schedule 2 § 2(g)</cite>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Burlington requires substantial coverage:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Proof of insurance which includes a liability limit of no less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence for property damage and bodily injury, and identifies that a STA is being operated on the property."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 Schedule 1 § 1(j)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> liability per occurrence</li>
            <li><strong>Must identify</strong> that an STA is being operated on the property</li>
            <li><strong>City notification:</strong> Policy must give Burlington 10 days' written notice of cancellation or material changes</li>
            <li><strong>Standard homeowner's insurance won't cut it</strong>: You need STR-specific coverage</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Burlington uses administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) in addition to the demerit point system. The specific penalty amounts are set in the Administrative Monetary Penalties By-law 40-2016.</p>

          <p>For serious violations prosecuted under the Provincial Offences Act, fines can be significant. The bylaw also allows unpaid administrative penalties to be added to your property tax bill after 60 days.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Where an administrative penalty and administrative fee(s)...are not paid within sixty days after the date that they become due and payable, the treasurer of the City may add the administrative penalty and administrative fee(s) to the tax roll for any property for which all of the owners are responsible."
            <cite>Burlington By-law 01-2025 § 11.3</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Burlington</h2>
          <p>Given the demerit point system, compliance is essential. Here's how to protect your license:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Vet guests thoroughly.</strong> One party can cost you 8+ points and a suspension. Check reviews, ask about trip purpose, and trust your instincts. Declining a questionable booking is better than losing your license.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Make your Renter's Code clear.</strong> Include specific quiet hours, parking rules, maximum occupancy, and consequences. Have guests acknowledge receipt before check-in and keep records for at least a year.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Maintain 1-hour response capability 24/7.</strong> Either live nearby, have a reliable co-host, or work with a property manager. Missing a bylaw call costs demerit points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Track your nights carefully.</strong> With a 183-night annual limit, you need to know exactly how many nights you've rented. Don't accidentally exceed the cap.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Keep your paperwork current.</strong> License expires one year from issuance. Insurance certificates need to stay valid. HVAC inspections should be up to date.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Post your license visibly.</strong> It needs to be displayed "permanently in a prominent place" in the STA. Not posting it is 1-3 demerit points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Follow your parking and maintenance plans.</strong> You submitted these with your application. Violations of either earn demerit points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Check condo rules first.</strong> Even with a City license, your condo corporation can ban STRs. Their rules override municipal permission.</li>
          </ul>
