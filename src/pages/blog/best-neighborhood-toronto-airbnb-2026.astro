const faqs = [
  { q: "What is the best neighborhood in Toronto for Airbnb?", a: "King West and the Entertainment District is the #1 neighborhood for Airbnb in Toronto. It has the highest demand from tourists and business travelers, the most STR-friendly condo buildings (20+), and top performers earn $9,000-$12,000/month. Proximity to Scotiabank Arena, theatres, and restaurants drives year-round bookings." },
  { q: "Which Toronto neighborhoods have the most Airbnb-friendly condos?", a: "Based on City of Toronto STR registration data, King West leads with 20 STR-friendly buildings, followed by CityPlace/Fort York (18), Yorkville/Bay (17), East End (15), Harbourfront (12), and Liberty Village (10). Having many proven STR buildings reduces the risk of condo board issues." },
  { q: "Is Yorkville good for Airbnb in Toronto?", a: "Yes, Yorkville commands the highest nightly rates in Toronto due to its luxury appeal. Average revenue is $4,000-$6,500/month with top performers reaching $8,000-$10,000/month. However, guests expect premium amenities and service, and purchase prices are among the highest in the city." },
  { q: "Is Queen West good for Airbnb in Toronto?", a: "Yes. Queen West and Ossington have 7 STR-friendly buildings and average $2,400-$3,800/month. The neighborhood attracts younger travelers seeking trendy restaurants, bars, and the arts scene. Top performers can reach $5,000-$6,500/month by targeting the Instagram-worthy aesthetic guests expect." },
  { q: "Which Toronto neighborhood has the highest Airbnb revenue?", a: "Downtown neighborhoods consistently outperform. King West averages $3,500-$6,000/month with top performers at $9,000-$12,000/month. Yorkville has the highest rates per night but smaller sample size. CityPlace and Harbourfront also perform strongly at $2,800-$5,000/month average." },
  { q: "How do I find out if a Toronto condo allows Airbnb?", a: "We maintain a complete list of 400+ Toronto condos with registered STR units. Check our guide to Toronto condos that allow Airbnb. Having existing STR registrations in a building is a strong indicator that the condo corporation permits short term rentals." },
  { q: "Is Liberty Village good for Airbnb?", a: "Liberty Village is a solid mid-tier option with 10 STR-friendly buildings and $2,600-$4,000/month average revenue. It attracts young professionals, tech workers, and CNE/Exhibition Place visitors. Less competition than the downtown core with consistent demand." },
  { q: "Is the Financial District good for Airbnb?", a: "Yes. The Financial District and Front Street area has 8 STR-friendly buildings with strong weekday demand from business travelers. Average revenue is $2,800-$4,500/month with top performers reaching $6,000-$8,000/month. Union Station access and convention center proximity drive consistent corporate bookings." }

            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
            <p><strong>King West and the Entertainment District</strong> is the #1 neighborhood for Airbnb in Toronto. It combines the highest demand, most STR-friendly buildings, and top earners reaching $9,000-$12,000/month. But it's not the right choice for everyone.</p>

          <h2 id="overview">Overview: How We Ranked Toronto Neighborhoods</h2>
          <p>We evaluated each neighborhood on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> What are listings actually earning?</li>
            <li><strong>STR-friendly buildings:</strong> How many condos have proven STR registrations?</li>
            <li><strong>Demand consistency:</strong> Is demand year-round or seasonal?</li>
            <li><strong>Guest types:</strong> Who books in this area?</li>
            <li><strong>Entry cost:</strong> What does it cost to buy here?</li>
          </ul>

            <p><strong>Who books here:</strong> Tourists, business travelers, concert/sports attendees, bachelor/ette parties, theatre-goers.</p>

              <p>Higher purchase prices ($600K+ for 2BR). More competition from other hosts. Noise bylaws are strictly enforced. Success requires <a href="/services/full-airbnb-management">professional management</a> and optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Why #2:</strong> CityPlace has the highest concentration of STR-friendly buildings in Toronto. CN Tower views are a major selling point. Walking distance to downtown attractions with modern amenities. Lower risk of condo board issues since STRs are well-established here.</p>
