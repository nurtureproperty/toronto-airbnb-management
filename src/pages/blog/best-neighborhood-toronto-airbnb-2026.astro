const faqs = [
  { q: "What is the best neighborhood in Toronto for Airbnb?", a: "King West and the Entertainment District is the #1 neighborhood for Airbnb in Toronto. It has the highest demand from tourists and business travelers, the most STR-friendly condo buildings (20+), and top performers earn $9,000-$12,000/month. Proximity to Scotiabank Arena, theatres, and restaurants drives year-round bookings." },
  { q: "Which Toronto neighborhoods have the most Airbnb-friendly condos?", a: "Based on City of Toronto STR registration data, Humber Bay/Etobicoke leads with 26 STR-friendly buildings, followed by King West (20), North York (19), CityPlace/Fort York (18), Yorkville/Bay (17), and East End (15). Having many proven STR buildings reduces the risk of condo board issues." },
  { q: "Is Yorkville good for Airbnb in Toronto?", a: "Yes, Yorkville commands the highest nightly rates in Toronto due to its luxury appeal. Average revenue is $4,000-$6,500/month with top performers reaching $8,000-$10,000/month. However, guests expect premium amenities and service, and purchase prices are among the highest in the city." },
  { q: "Can I Airbnb in North York or Scarborough?", a: "Yes. Both North York (19 STR-friendly buildings) and Scarborough (10 buildings) have active short term rental markets. Rates are lower than downtown ($2,200-$3,500/month in North York, $1,800-$3,000/month in Scarborough), but entry costs are also lower. Target families, medical visitors, and zoo tourists." },
  { q: "Which Toronto neighborhood has the highest Airbnb revenue?", a: "Downtown neighborhoods consistently outperform. King West averages $3,500-$6,000/month with top performers at $9,000-$12,000/month. Yorkville has the highest rates per night but smaller sample size. CityPlace and Harbourfront also perform strongly at $2,800-$5,000/month average." },
  { q: "How do I find out if a Toronto condo allows Airbnb?", a: "We maintain a complete list of 400+ Toronto condos with registered STR units. Check our guide to Toronto condos that allow Airbnb. Having existing STR registrations in a building is a strong indicator that the condo corporation permits short term rentals." },
  { q: "Is Liberty Village good for Airbnb?", a: "Liberty Village is a solid mid-tier option with 10 STR-friendly buildings and $2,600-$4,000/month average revenue. It attracts young professionals, tech workers, and CNE/Exhibition Place visitors. Less competition than the downtown core with consistent demand." },
  { q: "Should I buy near the airport for Airbnb?", a: "Humber Bay and Etobicoke near the airport have 26 STR-friendly buildings with lower purchase prices and less competition. Average revenue is $2,400-$4,000/month. Good for airport layovers and business travelers, but further from main tourist attractions." }

            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
            <p><strong>King West and the Entertainment District</strong> is the #1 neighborhood for Airbnb in Toronto. It combines the highest demand, most STR-friendly buildings, and top earners reaching $9,000-$12,000/month. But it's not the right choice for everyone.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="overview">Overview: How We Ranked Toronto Neighborhoods</h2>
          <p>We evaluated each neighborhood on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> What are listings actually earning?</li>
            <li><strong>STR-friendly buildings:</strong> How many condos have proven STR registrations?</li>
            <li><strong>Demand consistency:</strong> Is demand year-round or seasonal?</li>
            <li><strong>Guest types:</strong> Who books in this area?</li>
            <li><strong>Entry cost:</strong> What does it cost to buy here?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Data sources: City of Toronto STR registry, AirDNA market data, and our own portfolio performance across 50+ managed properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Why #2:</strong> CityPlace has the highest concentration of STR-friendly buildings in Toronto. CN Tower views are a major selling point. Walking distance to downtown attractions with modern amenities. Lower risk of condo board issues since STRs are well-established here.</p>

            <p><strong>Who books here:</strong> Tourists seeking CN Tower views, business travelers, families visiting Toronto.</p>
