const faqs = [
  { q: "What is a mid-term rental?", a: "A mid-term rental is a furnished rental with stays of 30 to 89 days. It sits between short-term rentals (under 30 days) and traditional long-term leases (12+ months). In the GTA, mid-term rentals are exempt from most short-term rental bylaws because they exceed the 28 or 30 day threshold that triggers STR licensing requirements." },
  { q: "Do I need an STR license for a mid-term rental in Toronto?", a: "No. Toronto's short-term rental regulations only apply to rentals of 28 consecutive days or less. If your minimum stay is 30 days or longer, you don't need an STR registration, you're not subject to the 180-night cap, and you don't need to pay the 8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax. The same applies across most GTA municipalities." },
  { q: "Can I mid-term rent my investment property?", a: "Yes. Unlike short-term rentals, mid-term rentals don't require the property to be your principal residence in most GTA cities. This makes mid-term rentals one of the few ways to legally earn premium rental income from an investment property in Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, and other regulated markets." },
  { q: "How much can I earn from a mid-term rental in Toronto?", a: "A furnished 1-bedroom condo in Toronto typically rents for $2,800 to $3,500 per month on a mid-term basis, compared to $2,000 to $2,200 unfurnished long-term. Two-bedroom units range from $3,500 to $5,000 per month. The premium comes from furnishing, flexibility, and the convenience of a move-in ready home." },
  { q: "Does the Residential Tenancies Act apply to mid-term rentals?", a: "It depends on the arrangement. Rentals of 30 days or more can fall under the RTA if they meet certain criteria (the tenant uses it as their primary residence, shares a kitchen or bathroom with the landlord, etc.). However, many mid-term arrangements are structured to remain outside the RTA. Consult a legal professional to ensure your lease structure is compliant." },
  { q: "What platforms should I list my mid-term rental on?", a: "Airbnb (with 30-day minimum stay), Furnished Finder, corporate housing directories, and Kijiji are the most effective platforms in the GTA. Airbnb's monthly stay discount feature works well for mid-term. Furnished Finder specifically targets traveling professionals and is popular with healthcare workers on contract assignments." },
  { q: "Who rents mid-term in Toronto?", a: "The most common mid-term tenants are corporate employees on temporary assignments, healthcare professionals on contract, insurance displacement families (whose homes are being repaired), film and TV production crews, new immigrants settling into the city, and digital nomads. These tenants typically have verified income and treat properties well." },
  { q: "How does Nurture help with mid-term rental management?", a: "Nurture handles everything from listing optimization and tenant screening to lease management and turnover coordination. We market your property across multiple platforms, vet tenants thoroughly, handle all communication, and coordinate cleaning between stays. Our management fee is 10-15% of rental revenue with no long-term contracts." }

            <p class="lead">Mid-term rentals are quietly becoming the smartest play for GTA property owners. <strong>No STR license, no principal residence requirement, no night caps, and 20-50% more income than long-term leasing.</strong> Whether you own an investment property that can't legally be an Airbnb or you want to fill gaps between short-term bookings, this guide covers everything you need to know.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-mid-term">What Is a Mid-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>A mid-term rental is a furnished rental with stays ranging from 30 to 89 days. It occupies the space between short-term rentals (nightly Airbnb bookings under 30 days) and traditional long-term leases (12 months or more).</p>

          <p>The 30-day threshold matters because that's where most Ontario municipalities draw the line for short-term rental regulations. Stay above it, and you're operating in a different regulatory category entirely.</p>

              <strong>Key Distinction:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Toronto defines short-term rentals as stays of 28 consecutive days or less. Most other GTA cities use 28 or 30 days. Any rental above that threshold is not considered an STR and is exempt from STR-specific bylaws, licensing, and taxes.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="why-mid-term">Why GTA Hosts Are Choosing Mid-Term</h2>
          <p>Mid-term rentals have surged in popularity across the GTA for one simple reason: they combine the income premium of short-term rentals with the simplicity of long-term leasing. Here's what makes them attractive.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>No STR License Required</h4>
              <p>Skip the registration process, fire inspections, insurance certificates, and annual renewal fees that come with operating an Airbnb in cities like Toronto, Mississauga, and Brampton.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>No Principal Residence Rule</h4>
              <p>Most GTA cities restrict Airbnb to your primary home. Mid-term rentals have no such restriction, making them ideal for <a href="/blog/airbnb-investment-property-gta">investment properties</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>No Night Limits</h4>
              <p>Toronto's 180-night cap on entire-home Airbnb rentals doesn't apply. You can rent mid-term 365 days a year without restrictions.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="info-grid" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>No MAT Tax</h4>
              <p>Toronto's 8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax and similar levies in other cities only apply to short-term stays. Mid-term rentals are exempt.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Less Turnover</h4>
              <p>Instead of cleaning and resetting every few days, you're turning over every one to three months. Lower cleaning costs, less wear, and less management overhead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Higher Quality Tenants</h4>
              <p>Corporate professionals, healthcare workers, and relocating families tend to be reliable, quiet, and respectful of the property. They treat it as a temporary home, not a weekend getaway.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="how-much-earn">How Much Can You Earn?</h2>
          <p>Mid-term rentals command a premium over unfurnished long-term leases because they offer convenience: fully furnished, move-in ready, with flexible terms. The premium varies by property type and location, but across the GTA, expect 20-50% more than traditional rents.</p>

          <p class="table-note">Estimates based on Toronto and inner GTA market data, 2026. Actual rates depend on neighborhood, furnishing quality, and amenities. Downtown and transit-accessible locations command higher premiums.</p>

          <p>The upfront investment in furnishing is typically $5,000 to $15,000 for a condo, which pays for itself within three to six months of mid-term rental income. After that, the premium is pure profit.</p>

          <h3>Revenue Compared to Airbnb</h3>
          <p>Mid-term rentals earn less per night than short-term Airbnb stays, but they compensate with near-full occupancy, zero cleaning fees between guests, and no platform service fees on some channels. For properties that can't legally operate as Airbnb (investment properties, restricted condos), mid-term is often the highest-earning legal option.</p>

          <p>Many Nurture clients use a <strong>blended strategy</strong>: Airbnb during peak months (May through October) when nightly rates are highest, then mid-term bookings during slower winter months. This maximizes annual revenue while maintaining near-full occupancy year-round.</p>

          <h2 id="who-rents">Who Rents Mid-Term in Toronto?</h2>
          <p>The GTA has strong, consistent demand for furnished mid-term housing from several key demographics.</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Corporate Relocations</h4>
              <p>Employees transferring to Toronto offices often need 60 to 90 days of furnished housing while they find a permanent home. Companies frequently cover the cost, meaning reliable payment and professional tenants.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Healthcare Professionals</h4>
              <p>Nurses, doctors, and specialists on contract assignments at GTA hospitals need temporary housing near their facility. These contracts typically run 30 to 90 days, perfectly aligning with mid-term stays.</p>
            </div>

              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Insurance Displacement</h4>
              <p>When homes suffer fire, flood, or other damage, insurance companies pay for temporary housing while repairs are completed. These stays average 60 to 120 days, with insurance covering the full rental cost.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Film &amp; TV Production</h4>
              <p>Toronto is North America's third-largest film production hub. Crews and talent need furnished housing for the duration of a shoot, typically 30 to 90 days. Productions have dedicated housing budgets.</p>
            </div>

              <h4>New Immigrants &amp; Students</h4>
              <p>Newcomers arriving in Toronto need a landing pad while they search for permanent housing, open bank accounts, and get settled. International students arriving before the academic year also book mid-term stays.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">6</span>
              <h4>Renovation &amp; Between-Homes</h4>
              <p>Homeowners renovating their primary residence or in the gap between selling and buying need temporary furnished housing. These tenants are motivated to keep the space in good condition.</p>

          <h2 id="legal-advantages">Legal Advantages: No License Required</h2>
          <p>The biggest draw of mid-term rentals is what you don't need. Across the GTA, rentals of 30+ days are exempt from most short-term rental regulations.</p>

              <strong>Important: RTA Considerations</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Rentals of 30 days or more may fall under Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act depending on the arrangement. This gives tenants certain rights, including eviction protections. Structuring your lease correctly is critical. Consult a legal professional to ensure your mid-term rental agreement is properly set up.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Condo Board Rules Still Apply</h3>
          <p>Even though mid-term rentals avoid city STR bylaws, your <a href="/blog/can-i-airbnb-my-condo-toronto-2026">condo corporation's rules</a> still apply. Many condo boards that prohibit short-term rentals do allow mid-term rentals (30+ days). However, some boards restrict all rental activity or require minimum lease terms of 6 or 12 months. Check your condo declaration and rules before listing.</p>

          <h2 id="setup">Setting Up Your Property for Mid-Term Success</h2>
          <p>Mid-term tenants expect a home, not a hotel room. Here's how to set up your property to attract premium tenants and command top rates.</p>

          <h3>Furnishing Essentials</h3>
          <p>Mid-term tenants need everything they'd have in their own home. The basics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Full cookware set, dishes, cutlery, coffee maker, toaster, and basic pantry staples. Mid-term tenants cook most meals at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Bedroom:</strong> Quality mattress, multiple pillow options, blackout curtains, and adequate closet space with hangers. They're living here for months, not days.</li>
            <li><strong>Workspace:</strong> A desk with a comfortable chair and good lighting. Most mid-term tenants work remotely at least part of the time.</li>
            <li><strong>Laundry:</strong> In-unit washer/dryer is a major advantage. If not available, proximity to laundry facilities is important.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> High-speed, reliable WiFi is non-negotiable. Include it in the rental price.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pricing Strategy</h3>
          <p>Price your mid-term rental based on comparable furnished listings in your area, not unfurnished long-term rents. Factor in:</p>

          <p>For many GTA property owners, mid-term rentals hit the sweet spot: significantly more income than long-term leasing, with far less regulatory burden than Airbnb. They're particularly compelling for investment properties and condos where short-term rentals are restricted.</p>
