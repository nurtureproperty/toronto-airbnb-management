const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb an investment property in Edmonton?", a: "Yes. Edmonton does not have a principal residence requirement. You can operate a short-term rental on an investment property, a second home, or any dwelling unit you own, as long as you hold a valid Residential Rental Accommodation (Short-Term) business licence for each property." },
  { q: "How much does an Edmonton STR licence cost?", a: "The business licence fee is $94 per year per dwelling. The licence expires one year from issuance and must be renewed annually. You apply online through Edmonton's self-serve business licence portal." },
  { q: "Is there a night limit in Edmonton?", a: "No. Edmonton does not impose an annual cap on the number of nights you can rent your property as a short-term rental. You can operate year-round without restriction, unlike Toronto's 180-night limit or similar caps in Ontario cities." },
  { q: "What taxes apply to Edmonton Airbnb income?", a: "The main tax is the 4% Alberta Tourism Levy on all stays under 28 consecutive days. As of October 2024, Airbnb collects and remits this automatically. You also owe 5% GST (no PST in Alberta) if earning over $30,000/year. All rental income must be reported to the CRA." },
  { q: "Do I need insurance for my Edmonton Airbnb?", a: "Edmonton does not mandate a specific minimum liability amount like Ontario cities require ($2M). However, standard homeowner's insurance typically does not cover short-term rental activity. The City strongly recommends contacting your insurer to ensure adequate STR coverage." },
  { q: "What is the Operational Plan for Guest Management?", a: "It's a mandatory document submitted with your licence application. It details your guest check-in/check-out procedures, house rules, noise and parking compliance measures, emergency contacts, and advertising methods. The City must approve it before your licence is issued." },
  { q: "How many guests can I have?", a: "If you live on-site, the limit is 2 sleeping units with a maximum of 2 persons per unit (4 guests total). Exceeding this requires a Major Home-Based Business Development Permit. If you rent the entire dwelling and don't live on-site, capacity is determined by fire code and building code compliance." },
  { q: "Do I need a development permit?", a: "Only in specific situations: if you rent 4 or more sleeping units separately in one building, if you're a host living on-site renting more than 2 sleeping units, or if you're operating from a secondary suite or backyard housing unit that needs construction permits." },
  { q: "What are the noise rules?", a: "Edmonton's Community Standards Bylaw prohibits residential noise from 10 PM to 7 AM, seven days a week. Violations carry a $250 fine. Hosts are responsible for ensuring guests comply with these rules." },
  { q: "What happens if I operate without a licence?", a: "Operating without a valid business licence can result in a $2,000 fine per violation. In 2019, Edmonton issued 149 tickets to unlicensed short-term rental operators. The City actively monitors platforms for unlicensed listings." }

            <p class="lead">Edmonton is one of the most <strong>host-friendly major cities in Canada</strong> for short-term rentals. No principal residence requirement, no annual night cap, and a licence fee of just $94/year. Investment properties are welcome.</p>
            <p class="lead">The rules are governed by <strong>Business Licence Bylaw 20002</strong>, which replaced the former Bylaw 13138 on January 17, 2022. Here's everything you need to know to operate legally in Edmonton.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Edmonton defines a short-term rental as any residential accommodation rented for <strong>30 consecutive days or less</strong> for compensation. The City categorizes these under "Residential Rental Accommodation (Short-Term)" business licences.</p>

          <p>Two rental types exist under this definition:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Entire dwelling rentals</strong>: The host is not on-site during the guest's stay</li>
            <li><strong>Individual room rentals</strong>: The host resides on-site while renting rooms to guests</li>
          </ul>

              <strong>30 days vs 180 days:</strong> Edmonton uses a 30-day threshold, unlike <a href="/blog/calgary-airbnb-short-term-rental-rules-2026">Calgary's 180-day definition</a>. Stays of 31+ days in Edmonton fall outside STR regulations entirely.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="no-principal-residence">No Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is where Edmonton stands apart from most Canadian cities. <strong>You do not need to live in the property to rent it short-term.</strong></p>

          </div>

          <p>A business licence is required for each dwelling used as a short-term rental, regardless of whether you live there or not. The operational rules differ slightly depending on whether the host resides on-site:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Host on-site:</strong> Maximum 2 sleeping units, each accommodating up to 2 persons. Exceeding this requires a Major Home-Based Business Development Permit.</li>
            <li><strong>Host not on-site:</strong> No inherent cap on sleeping units. Capacity is determined by fire code and building code compliance.</li>
          </ul>

            <h4>Why This Matters for Investors</h4>
            <p>In <a href="/blog/toronto-airbnb-short-term-rental-regulations-2026">Toronto</a>, <a href="/blog/mississauga-airbnb-short-term-rental-rules-2026">Mississauga</a>, <a href="/blog/brampton-airbnb-short-term-rental-guide-2026">Brampton</a>, and most Ontario cities, <a href="/blog/airbnb-investment-property-gta">investment properties cannot be used for Airbnb</a>. Edmonton and <a href="/blog/calgary-airbnb-short-term-rental-rules-2026">Calgary</a> are among Canada's most flexible markets for STR investors.</p>

          <h2 id="licence-requirements">Business Licence Requirements</h2>
          <p>Every short-term rental in Edmonton requires a valid business licence. Here's what you need:</p>

          <h2 id="operational-plan">Operational Plan for Guest Management</h2>
          <p>Edmonton requires all STR applicants to submit an Operational Plan for Guest Management with their licence application. This is a City-approved document that must detail:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising methods</strong> and platforms used (Airbnb, VRBO, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Guest check-in and check-out procedures</strong></li>
            <li><strong>House rules</strong> provided to guests</li>
            <li><strong>Noise, waste, and parking</strong> bylaw compliance measures</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency contact information</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Guest communication procedures</strong></li>
            <li>Prohibition on <strong>guest-operated unlicensed businesses</strong> from the property</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The plan must be submitted for City approval with your application. If your operational procedures change after licensing, a revised plan must be submitted.</p>

          <h2 id="permits">Development Permits & Zoning</h2>
          <p>Most Edmonton hosts will not need a development permit. However, permits are required in these situations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>4+ sleeping units</strong> rented separately in one building: Both a Development Permit and Building Permit required</li>
            <li><strong>Host on-site renting 3+ sleeping units:</strong> Requires a Major Home-Based Business Development Permit</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary suites or backyard housing:</strong> Must have proper Development and Building Permits confirming the suite was legally constructed</li>
            <li><strong>Physical modifications:</strong> Any changes to the floor plan (new bedrooms, finished basements) require permits</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Edmonton's Zoning Bylaw (Charter Bylaw 20001, effective January 1, 2024) does not explicitly prohibit short-term rentals in specific zones, but zoning compliance is required for any development permits.</p>

          <h2 id="taxes">Taxes and Levies</h2>
          <p>Edmonton hosts face fewer taxes than most Ontario cities. There is no separate municipal accommodation tax (MAT).</p>

          <h3>Alberta Tourism Levy (4%)</h3>
          <p>The provincial tourism levy is the main tax on short-term rentals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rate:</strong> 4% of the purchase price of accommodation</li>
            <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> Base price plus cleaning fees, pet fees, amenity fees, booking/service charges</li>
            <li><strong>Platform collection:</strong> As of October 1, 2024, Airbnb and other registered platforms collect and remit the levy automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Direct bookings:</strong> Hosts accepting direct bookings must collect and remit the levy themselves</li>
            <li><strong>Exemptions:</strong> Stays of 28+ consecutive days are exempt</li>
            <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Through TRACS at Alberta.ca</li>
            <li><strong>Remittance:</strong> Quarterly for hosts with fewer than 50 rooms</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>GST (5%)</h3>
          <p>Alberta has no provincial sales tax. Only the federal 5% GST applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hosts earning over <strong>$30,000/year</strong> must register for a GST account with the CRA</li>
            <li>Airbnb collects and remits GST on behalf of hosts who are not registered</li>
            <li>All rental income must be reported to the CRA regardless of amount</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Tax Advantage: Alberta vs Ontario</h4>
            <p>Edmonton hosts pay 5% GST compared to 13% HST in Ontario. Combined with no municipal accommodation tax (Toronto charges 8.5%, most Ontario cities charge 4%), the tax burden is significantly lower. For a deeper comparison, see our <a href="/blog/airbnb-taxes-canada-gta-guide-2026">Canadian Airbnb tax guide</a>.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="occupancy-rules">Occupancy and Operating Rules</h2>

          <h3>Maximum Occupancy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Host on-site:</strong> Maximum 2 sleeping units, each with up to 2 persons (4 guests total)</li>
            <li><strong>Entire dwelling (host absent):</strong> No city-mandated cap beyond fire code and building code limits</li>
            <li><strong>4+ sleeping units rented separately:</strong> Requires a Development Permit</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Host Obligations</h3>
          <p>Once licensed, Edmonton hosts must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Post a telephone number</strong> inside the property continuously for guest contact</li>
            <li><strong>Provide the City's official guest guide</strong> at check-in ("Short-Term Residential Rental Accommodation: Information for Guests")</li>
            <li><strong>Mark fire exits</strong> clearly and consider providing fire extinguishers</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to guest inquiries promptly</strong> to prevent neighbourhood complaints</li>
            <li><strong>Display licence number</strong> on all listings and advertisements</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Waste Management</h3>
          <p>Hosts are responsible for educating guests on Edmonton's waste collection rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blue bags, food scraps carts, and garbage carts must be set out by 7 AM on collection days</li>
            <li>Carts must remain 1 metre apart</li>
            <li>No setting out waste on non-collection days</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="fire-safety">Fire Safety Requirements</h2>
          <p>Fire safety is governed by the Alberta Fire Code. Key requirements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Smoke alarms:</strong> Mandatory in all dwelling units, hardwired with battery backup, interconnected</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon monoxide detectors:</strong> Required in all units</li>
            <li><strong>Fire extinguishers:</strong> Recommended (at least one accessible to guests)</li>
            <li><strong>Fire exits:</strong> Must be clearly marked</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency egress:</strong> Bedrooms must have openable windows or exterior doors meeting building code requirements</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="noise-parking">Noise and Parking Rules</h2>

          <h3>Noise (Community Standards Bylaw 14600)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Quiet hours:</strong> 10 PM to 7 AM, seven days a week</li>
            <li><strong>Fine:</strong> $250 per violation</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Edmonton Police Service (780-423-4567)</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Call 311 for general complaints or EPS non-emergency line for loud parties</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Guests have the same access to public street parking as neighbourhood residents. Common infractions to warn guests about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vehicles parked 72+ hours without moving may be towed</li>
            <li>No parking within 1.5 metres of a driveway</li>
            <li>No parking within 5 metres of intersections, fire hydrants, crosswalks, stop signs, or yield signs</li>
            <li>No parking on boulevards or square-top curbs</li>
            <li>Winter parking bans must be observed</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Residential Parking Program Areas</h4>
            <p>If your STR property is in a Residential Parking Program zone, <strong>you must provide on-property parking</strong> for guests. Street parking cannot be relied upon in these areas. Check with the City whether your neighbourhood participates.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Edmonton enforces its STR rules through fines and licence actions:</p>

          <div class="points-table">
            <table>
              <thead>

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>The City also has the authority to <strong>revoke or refuse to renew</strong> your licence for repeated violations or non-compliance with licence conditions.</p>

          <h2 id="condo-rules">Condo Considerations</h2>
          <p>Even though Edmonton's municipal rules are permissive, <strong>your condo corporation can still prohibit short-term rentals</strong>. The City's business licence does not override private condo bylaws.</p>

          <p>Before applying for a licence:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review your condo corporation's bylaws for any STR restrictions</li>
            <li>Check if your homeowner association has rules against short-term rentals</li>
            <li>Get written confirmation from your condo board if permitted</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Edmonton</h2>
          <p>Edmonton's rules are straightforward compared to most cities. Here's how to stay on the right side:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Get your licence before listing.</strong> At $94/year, it's one of the cheapest in Canada. Not worth the $2,000 fine for skipping it.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Submit a thorough Operational Plan.</strong> The City must approve it before your licence is issued. Download the official template and fill it out completely.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Display your licence number on every listing.</strong> Airbnb, VRBO, your own website. Missing it flags you for enforcement.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Provide the City's guest guide at check-in.</strong> This covers noise rules, parking, and waste collection. It protects you from guest-caused violations.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Install proper fire safety equipment.</strong> Smoke alarms, CO detectors, and marked fire exits. Alberta Health Services may inspect after licensing.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Confirm Airbnb is collecting the Tourism Levy.</strong> Since October 2024, platforms handle this automatically. For direct bookings, register through TRACS and remit quarterly.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Check your condo bylaws.</strong> Edmonton allows STRs, but your condo corporation might not. Verify before investing in setup.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Keep your Operational Plan updated.</strong> If you change platforms, procedures, or house rules, submit a revised plan to the City.</li>
          </ul>
