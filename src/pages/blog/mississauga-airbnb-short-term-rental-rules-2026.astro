const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Mississauga?", a: "No, and this catches a lot of investors off guard. Mississauga only allows STRs at your principal residence, meaning the place you actually live. Got a rental condo near Square One? Can't STR it. But here's the workaround: mid-term rentals (31+ days) are exempt from these rules entirely." },
  { q: "What is the night limit for Airbnb in Mississauga?", a: "180 days per calendar year. Resets every January 1st. And here's the thing: it's the total across ALL platforms combined. Airbnb, VRBO, direct bookings, that random Facebook inquiry. They all count toward your 180." },
  { q: "How much is the Mississauga STR license?", a: "The city sets fees through their User Fees schedule. Check the city website for current rates since they update periodically. You'll pay annually when you renew. Not cheap, but also not the biggest expense you'll face." },
  { q: "Can I rent my basement apartment on Airbnb in Mississauga?", a: "Yes, if you live in the basement (it's your principal residence). But detached structures are a no-go. Coach houses, garage suites, laneway homes that are separate buildings. Those aren't allowed for STR in Mississauga." },
  { q: "Do I need insurance for my Mississauga Airbnb?", a: "Absolutely. $2,000,000 minimum in commercial general liability. And here's the kicker: the City of Mississauga has to be listed as additional insured on your policy. Your regular home insurance won't cut it." },
  { q: "Can a corporation own an STR license in Mississauga?", a: "Nope. Individual people only. Your numbered company can't hold the license. Neither can your partnership. It's got to be you, personally, 18+ years old." },
  { q: "What records do I need to keep?", a: "Everything, for 3 years minimum. Nights rented, prices charged, entire vs partial unit, any MAT collected. If the city asks for records, you've got 30 days to produce them. Don't wing it. Set up a system from day one." },
  { q: "Can I rent to multiple groups at the same time?", a: "No. One group at a time. You can't have different guests in different rooms simultaneously, even if they're paying separately. It's not like a hostel situation." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Mississauga and Toronto rules?", a: "Both have 180-day limits and principal residence requirements. The key difference: Mississauga uses 30 days as the STR cutoff while Toronto uses 28 days. Two days doesn't sound like much, but it matters for your mid-term strategy." }

          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Mississauga's STR rules under <strong>By-Law 0289-2020</strong> are pretty similar to Toronto's, but there are a few key differences that matter. If you're thinking about Airbnb in Mississauga, whether you live near Square One, Port Credit, or out in Meadowvale, here's what you actually need to know.</p>
            <p class="lead">I'll cut through the legal jargon and give you the practical stuff: the 180-day limit, why your investment property won't work, and how mid-term rentals can save your rental income strategy.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What's Considered a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>First, the definition. This is where Mississauga differs from Toronto:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short Term Rental Accommodation means a temporary accommodation in all or part of a Dwelling that is provided for 30 consecutive days or less in exchange for payment or service."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Section 1</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So anything 30 days or shorter needs a license and follows all the STR rules. Book someone for 31 days? That's mid-term. Completely different category, completely different rules (or really, lack of rules).</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Toronto vs Mississauga:</strong> Toronto's cutoff is 28 days. Mississauga's is 30 days. Seems like a tiny difference, but it actually matters if you're trying to max out short-term before switching to mid-term. Those two extra days give you a bit more flexibility here.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="night-limit">The 180-Day Cap</h2>
          <p>Same as Toronto. You've got 180 days per year to work with:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Licensee shall rent out a Short Term Rental Accommodation for more than 180 days in a calendar year."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Schedule B, Section 7(1)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The basics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calendar year counting, from January 1st to December 31st</li>
            <li>Everything counts: Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, direct bookings, your buddy who paid cash</li>
            <li>Resets every New Year's Day</li>
            <li>You need to track this yourself. Keep records for 3+ years.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Honestly, 180 days is about half the year. Time it right with peak summer season and you can still make great money.</p>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Rule (This Is the Big One)</h2>
          <p>This rule trips up more people than any other. You can ONLY short-term rent where you actually live:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Person shall operate, advertise, broker, carry on the business of or permit the operation...of a Short Term Rental Accommodation unless the property is the Principal Residence of that Person."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Schedule B, Section 6(1)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The city defines this pretty clearly:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal Residence means a Dwelling owned or rented by an individual person, either alone or jointly with others, where the individual person is ordinarily resident."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Section 1</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Property Owners: Read This</h4>
            <p>I know this isn't what you want to hear, but if you bought a condo in Square One as an investment, you <strong>can't</strong> short-term rent it. Same goes for any second property, vacation property, or inherited home you don't live in.</p>
            <p>The good news? <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">Mid-term rentals</a> (31+ days) are exempt from all of this. That's your path forward.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: How Investment Properties Actually Work</h2>
          <p>Here's the strategy that actually works in Mississauga. Since STR rules only apply to stays of 30 days or less, <strong>31+ day rentals play by completely different rules</strong>.</p>

          <h3>What Changes at 31 Days?</h3>
          <p>Book someone for 31 consecutive days or more and suddenly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No STR license needed</li>
            <li>Doesn't touch your 180-day cap</li>
            <li>Principal residence? Doesn't matter</li>
            <li>Your investment property is fair game</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>The Play Smart Mississauga Hosts Are Making</h4>
            <p>Combine both rental types strategically:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>May through October:</strong> Short-term Airbnb at peak rates. Pearson Airport travelers, families visiting, summer tourists. This is when you burn through your 180 days.</li>
              <li><strong>November through April:</strong> Flip to 31+ day rentals. Corporate relocations, UTM students, healthcare workers at Trillium. There's consistent demand.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You stay under 180 days STR, maximize revenue year-round, and don't leave gaps in your calendar.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Who Actually Books Mid-Term in Mississauga?</h3>
          <p>Mississauga has genuinely strong demand for 31+ day stays. We're not making this up:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Corporate travelers:</strong> So many company HQs here. Microsoft Canada, Amazon warehouses, countless others in the business parks</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare workers:</strong> Trillium Health Partners is huge. Traveling nurses, contract workers, new hires needing temporary housing.</li>
            <li><strong>UTM students:</strong> University of Toronto Mississauga campus. Students between semesters, waiting for dorm availability, doing internships.</li>
            <li><strong>New immigrants:</strong> Mississauga has one of Canada's largest newcomer populations. People need furnished housing while they get settled.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance displacement:</strong> Families whose homes are being repaired after water damage, fire, whatever. Insurance companies pay for temporary housing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">Getting Your License</h2>
          <p>You can't just list on Airbnb and hope for the best. Mississauga requires a license before you host anyone.</p>

          <h3>Who Can Apply?</h3>
          <p>Not everyone qualifies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Individuals only</strong>, your numbered company can't hold this license</li>
            <li><strong>18+ years old</strong></li>
            <li><strong>One license per person</strong>, because you only have one principal residence, right?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What You'll Need to Apply</h3>
          <p>The application isn't complicated, but it's thorough. Gather these before you start:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Application form</strong> from the city</li>
            <li><strong>Proof you actually live there</strong>, ID plus a signed declaration</li>
            <li><strong>Criminal record check</strong> from the last 60 days (a fresh one)</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership proof</strong>, or if you're renting, written permission from your landlord</li>
            <li><strong>Condo clearance</strong> if you're in a condo, proof that your condo corp allows STRs</li>
            <li><strong>Building code compliance</strong>, certification that your place meets code</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance certificate</strong> with $2M liability and city named as additional insured</li>
            <li><strong>Fee</strong> (check the city's current rates)</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Renting your place?</strong> You'll need your landlord's written permission before the city will even process your application. Don't assume they'll say yes. Some landlords have strong feelings about this.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>License Renewal</h3>
          <p>Your license lasts <strong>one year</strong>. Then you renew and go through the whole thing again, yes, including another fresh criminal record check. Mark your calendar.</p>

          <h2 id="insurance">The $2 Million Insurance Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is where Mississauga gets serious. You need real commercial insurance:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "An insurance certificate demonstrating commercial general liability business insurance for the operations of the Short Term Rental Accommodation against claims filed against the Applicant with respect to bodily injury, including personal injury and death, and property damage with a per occurrence limit of at least $2,000,000."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Schedule A, Section 1(8)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Breaking that down:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> (no, $1M won't cut it)</li>
            <li>Has to cover bodily injury, personal injury, death, and property damage</li>
            <li><strong>City of Mississauga must be named</strong> as additional insured on the policy</li>
            <li>Must be actual commercial/business insurance (your regular condo insurance doesn't count)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Airbnb's AirCover Isn't Enough</h4>
            <p>I see this mistake constantly. People think "I've got AirCover, I'm good." You're not. Mississauga specifically requires your OWN policy with the city named as additional insured. AirCover is backup protection, not a replacement for what the city demands. Budget for real commercial insurance. It's usually $500-1,500/year depending on your property.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="property-types">Which Properties Work?</h2>
          <p>Assuming it's your principal residence, here's what qualifies:</p>

          <h3>Good to Go:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Single-family homes (common in Streetsville, Erin Mills, Clarkson)</li>
            <li>Townhouses</li>
            <li>Condo units (but check with your condo corp first, many say no)</li>
            <li>Apartments (need landlord permission in writing)</li>
            <li>Basement units (if that's where you actually live)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Not Allowed, No Exceptions:</h3>
          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Person shall operate...a Short Term Rental Accommodation located within an Accessory Building as defined in the City's Zoning By-law 225-2007."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Schedule B, Section 6(2)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Translation: detached structures are out. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coach houses or garage suites separate from the main house</li>
            <li>Backyard garden suites</li>
            <li>Any building that's not attached to your main home</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Condo Situation</h3>
          <p>Condos in Mississauga are tricky. Even if you get city approval, your condo corporation can still say no. And many do. Before you spend time and money on the license application, dig out your condo's declaration and rules. Look for anything about short-term rentals or minimum lease periods. I've seen hosts go through the whole process only to get shut down by their condo board afterward. Not fun.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance">Staying Compliant</h2>
          <p>Got your license? Great. Here's what you need to keep doing:</p>

          <h3>License Number Goes Everywhere</h3>
          <p>Every Airbnb listing, every VRBO listing, every ad. Your license number has to be visible. The city checks.</p>

          <h3>Guest Safety Stuff</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Give every guest your emergency contact number</li>
            <li>Post evacuation plans at entrances/exits (yes, really)</li>
            <li>Put your license number on all receipts and invoices</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>One Group at a Time</h3>
          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Licensee shall book or reserve separate guests in a Short Term Rental Accommodation for the same days, whereby two (2) or more unrelated or unassociated persons are accommodated in the same Dwelling at the same time."
            <cite>Mississauga By-Law 0289-2020, Schedule B, Section 7(2)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Can't run it like a hostel. One booking, one group. Even if you've got extra rooms you could rent separately, that's not allowed.</p>

          <h3>Keep Your Records (For 3 Years)</h3>
          <p>Track everything:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How many nights you rented each year</li>
            <li>What you charged (nightly and total)</li>
            <li>Entire unit vs partial unit</li>
            <li>Any accommodation tax collected</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the city asks for records, you've got 30 days to produce them. Don't be scrambling through old emails when that request comes in.</p>

          <h2 id="why-worth-it">Is It Actually Worth It in Mississauga?</h2>
          <p>With all these rules, you might wonder if it's even worth the hassle. Here's my honest take: <strong>yes, it usually is</strong>.</p>

          <h3>The Money Still Works</h3>
          <p>Even capped at 180 days, short-term typically beats long-term rent:</p>

          <div class="comparison-example">
            <h4>Real Numbers: 2-Bedroom Near Square One</h4>
            <div class="example-grid">
              <div class="example-item">
                <span class="label">Long-term tenant</span>
                <span class="value">$2,800/month</span>
                <span class="annual">$33,600/year</span>
              </div>
              <div class="example-item highlight">
                <span class="label">Airbnb (180 nights @ $180/night)</span>
                <span class="value">$32,400/year</span>
                <span class="annual">+ the other 185 days</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="example-note">That's just 180 nights of STR. Fill the rest with 31+ day rentals at $3,200/month and you're looking at $50,000+/year. That's nearly 50% more than a long-term tenant. And you keep control of your property.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Mississauga's Location Actually Helps</h3>
          <p>Here's why demand in Mississauga is genuinely strong:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pearson Airport:</strong> 5 minutes away. Flight crews, business travelers, people with 6am flights who don't want to wake up at 3am to drive from Toronto.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate HQs everywhere:</strong> Microsoft, Amazon, tons of companies in Meadowvale and Airport Corporate Centre. Executives and consultants need temporary housing.</li>
            <li><strong>Square One:</strong> Second largest mall in Canada. People come specifically to shop and want to stay nearby.</li>
            <li><strong>Toronto proximity without Toronto prices:</strong> Guests can easily take the GO Train or Uber to downtown Toronto while paying 20-30% less for accommodation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>You Keep Control</h3>
          <p>Unlike having a long-term tenant:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Need your place for visiting family? Block those dates.</li>
            <li>Major conference in town? Raise your rates.</li>
            <li>Guest being difficult? They're gone in a few days, not 12+ months of Landlord Tenant Board hearings.</li>
            <li>Sell your place? No lease to navigate around.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Don't Want to Deal With It?</h3>
          <p>Real talk: managing an STR takes work. If tracking nights, screening guests, handling turnovers, and staying compliant sounds like more than you want to deal with, that's exactly what we do. Property managers handle all of it so you get the income without the headaches.</p>

          <p>Don't take my word for it. Here's where to verify everything:</p>

          <div class="resources-box">
            <h4>Official Links</h4>
