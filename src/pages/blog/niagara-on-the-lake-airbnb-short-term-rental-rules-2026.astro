const faqs = [
  { q: "What's the difference between a Cottage Rental and a Villa?", a: "Cottage Rentals can have up to 3 guest rooms, while Villas have 4 or more. Both require the building to have been occupied for at least 8 consecutive years before licensing. Villas face stricter scrutiny due to their larger size and potential neighborhood impact." },
  { q: "What's the 8-year occupancy requirement?", a: "For most STR types (Cottage Rental, Country Inn, Villa), the building must have been continuously occupied for at least 8 years before you can apply for a license. This prevents new construction specifically for STR purposes and protects neighborhood character." },
  { q: "Can I run a B&B in NOTL?", a: "Yes, but B&Bs have a 4-year occupancy requirement (shorter than other types) and the owner must reside on-site. B&Bs are limited to 3 guest rooms maximum. If you want to be absent while guests stay, you need a different license type." },
  { q: "How long is the license valid?", a: "4 years, expiring on December 31st of the fourth year. So if you get licensed in 2026, your license expires December 31, 2029. Plan for renewal well in advance." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need?", a: "$2,000,000 liability insurance minimum, and the City must be named as an additional insured on your policy. This is stricter than most municipalities - contact your insurer about adding the municipal additional insured endorsement." },
  { q: "How quickly must I respond to complaints?", a: "45 minutes. The by-law requires you or your designated agent to respond to complaints within 45 minutes during guest stays. This is tighter than the typical 60-minute standard in other municipalities." },
  { q: "What happens if I get complaints?", a: "Three or more complaints in a calendar year about the same issue may result in license revocation. The Town takes repeat complaints seriously - address issues before they become patterns." },
  { q: "How long does the application take?", a: "Up to 10 weeks processing time. Applications submitted November 1-December 31 are issued the following year. Plan well ahead of your intended rental start date." }

            <p class="lead">Niagara-on-the-Lake (NOTL) is one of Ontario's most charming tourist destinations, known for its wineries, Shaw Festival theatre, and heritage architecture. STR demand is strong year-round, especially during theatre season.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Town's By-law 2025-032 creates a detailed framework with multiple license types and an unusual 8-year building occupancy requirement. It's designed to preserve NOTL's residential character while allowing tourism accommodation. Here's the complete guide.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="str-types">Understanding License Types</h2>
          <p>NOTL has one of Ontario's most complex STR classification systems:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term rental accommodation means accommodation for a period of twenty-eight (28) consecutive days or less, including Bed and Breakfast establishments, Cottage Rentals, Country Inns, Vacation Apartments, and Villas."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032 § Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">License Type</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Key Requirements</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col"><strong>Bed & Breakfast</strong></div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Max 3 rooms, owner on-site, 4-year occupancy</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col"><strong>Cottage Rental</strong></div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Max 3 rooms, 8-year occupancy</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col"><strong>Villa</strong></div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">4+ rooms, 8-year occupancy</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col"><strong>Country Inn</strong></div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Owner on-site, 8-year occupancy</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col"><strong>Vacation Apartment</strong></div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Within larger building</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The main distinctions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>B&B:</strong> Owner must be present during guest stays</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage Rental vs Villa:</strong> Size (3 rooms vs 4+)</li>
            <li><strong>Country Inn:</strong> Larger operation with owner on-site</li>
            <li><strong>Vacation Apartment:</strong> Unit within a multi-unit building</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="occupancy-requirements">The 8-Year Building Occupancy Rule</h2>
          <p>This is NOTL's most distinctive requirement:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A Cottage Rental, Country Inn, or Villa shall only be permitted in a building that has been occupied for a period of at least eight (8) consecutive years."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>What this means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>8 years of continuous occupancy</strong> before you can apply (most types)</li>
            <li><strong>4 years for B&Bs</strong> - shorter requirement</li>
            <li><strong>Prevents new STR construction</strong> - can't build for rental purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Protects existing housing stock</strong> - ensures buildings serve residents first</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Planning to Build and Rent?</h4>
            <p>If you're considering building a property in NOTL to rent short-term, you'll need to wait 8 years after the building is occupied before you can apply for most license types. The only exception is B&Bs, which require 4 years. This is a significant barrier to speculative STR development.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Application Requirements</h2>
          <p>NOTL has a detailed application process:</p>

          <h3>Application Timeline</h3>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>Issued following year</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Documentation Required</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof of 8-year (or 4-year) occupancy</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing guest rooms</li>
            <li><strong>Site plan</strong> showing parking</li>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 liability insurance</strong> with Town as additional insured</li>
            <li><strong>Designated agent</strong> contact information</li>
            <li><strong>Fire safety compliance</strong> documentation</li>
            <li><strong>Zoning compliance</strong> verification</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="bb-rules">B&B Specific Requirements</h2>
          <p>B&Bs have unique rules in NOTL:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A Bed and Breakfast shall be operated only when the owner resides on the premises and is present during the accommodation of guests."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>B&B-specific requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Owner must live on-site</strong> - not just own the property</li>
            <li><strong>Owner present during stays</strong> - can't leave while guests are there</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum 3 guest rooms</strong></li>
            <li><strong>4-year occupancy</strong> (vs 8 for other types)</li>
            <li><strong>Breakfast typically included</strong> (hence the name)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>B&B vs Cottage Rental:</strong> If you want to rent your entire home while you're away, you need a Cottage Rental license (8-year occupancy). B&B licenses require you to be on-site, making them better suited for hosts who want to live with guests.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>NOTL has stricter insurance requirements than most municipalities:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The licensee shall maintain liability insurance of no less than two million dollars ($2,000,000) and shall name the Town as an additional insured on the policy."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> liability coverage</li>
            <li><strong>Town as additional insured</strong> - this is unusual and requires specific endorsement</li>
            <li><strong>Certificate must be provided</strong> with application</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain continuously</strong> throughout license term</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Additional Insured Requirement</h4>
            <p>Most municipalities just require you to have insurance. NOTL requires the Town to be named as an "additional insured" on your policy. Contact your insurer - not all policies support this endorsement, and you may need specialized STR insurance to comply.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="response-time">45-Minute Response Requirement</h2>
          <p>NOTL has one of Ontario's strictest response time requirements:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The licensee or designated agent must respond to any complaint within forty-five (45) minutes during guest stays."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This is tighter than the typical 60-minute standard. You must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Be reachable 24/7</strong> during all guest stays</li>
            <li><strong>Respond within 45 minutes</strong> to any complaint</li>
            <li><strong>Have a local agent</strong> if you're not in the area</li>
            <li><strong>Address noise and nuisance issues</strong> promptly</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="complaints">Complaint and Revocation Rules</h2>
          <p>NOTL takes a firm stance on repeat problems:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Three (3) or more complaints in a calendar year regarding the same matter may result in license revocation."
            <cite>Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law 2025-032</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The complaint system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>3 complaints = potential revocation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Same matter</strong> - three noise complaints, or three parking issues</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar year</strong> - resets January 1st</li>
            <li><strong>May result</strong> - Town has discretion but will act on patterns</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Complaints</div>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>License revocation + fines</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in NOTL</h2>
          <p>NOTL's heritage character means strict enforcement. Here's how to succeed:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Verify your occupancy history.</strong> Before applying, ensure you can document 8 years (or 4 for B&B) of continuous building occupancy. Property records, utility bills, and tax records may help.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Get the right insurance early.</strong> Finding a policy that names the Town as additional insured takes time. Start this process before your license application.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Choose the right license type.</strong> If you want to be absent during guest stays, you need Cottage Rental or Villa (not B&B). Match your license type to your hosting style.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Set up 45-minute response.</strong> This is tighter than most municipalities. Have a local agent or property manager who can respond within 45 minutes, guaranteed.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Prevent complaint patterns.</strong> One noise complaint is manageable. Three in a year is a crisis. Communicate clear quiet hours and enforce them with guests.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Apply early for next year.</strong> Applications from November 1-December 31 are processed for the following year. Don't apply in December expecting a December license.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Track your 4-year license term.</strong> Licenses last 4 years - don't forget to renew. Operating on an expired license is operating illegally.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Build neighbor relationships.</strong> In a heritage town like NOTL, neighbors know each other. A friendly relationship can prevent complaints from escalating.</li>
          </ul>
