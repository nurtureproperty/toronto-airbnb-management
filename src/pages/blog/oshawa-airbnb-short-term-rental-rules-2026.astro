            <p class="lead"><strong>Oshawa is one of the few Durham Region cities with comprehensive STR regulations.</strong> If you're looking to Airbnb your home in Oshawa, you'll need to understand the licensing requirements, principal residence rules, and the 180-night annual limit.</p>
            <p class="lead">Here's everything you need to know about Oshawa's STR licensing bylaw and how to operate compliantly in 2026.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="overview">Oshawa STR Overview</h2>
          <p>Oshawa's short-term rental regulations are governed by Schedule "Q" of the Licensing By-law 122-2024. The city defines a short-term rental as:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "All or part of a dwelling unit that is used to provide temporary accommodation" through a rental company platform, requiring operator licensure.
            <cite>City of Oshawa Licensing By-law 122-2024, Schedule Q</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Oshawa uses <strong>28 days</strong> as the threshold, consistent with most GTA municipalities. Any rental under 28 consecutive days is considered a short-term rental and requires licensing.</p>

          <div class="key-stats">
            <div class="stat-item">
              <span class="stat-value">28 days</span>
              <span class="stat-label">STR threshold</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item highlight">
              <span class="stat-value">180/year</span>
              <span class="stat-label">Night limit</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
              <span class="stat-value">$150</span>
              <span class="stat-label">License fee</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
              <span class="stat-value">5%</span>
              <span class="stat-label">MAT rate</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is the key restriction. <strong>Oshawa requires your STR to be your principal residence.</strong> You cannot operate a short-term rental from an investment property, second home, or any property where you don't actually live.</p>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Properties Not Allowed</h4>
            <p>Unlike investor-friendly cities like Kingston or Sault Ste. Marie, Oshawa follows the same principal residence model as Toronto, Mississauga, and most GTA municipalities. If you own investment property in Oshawa, consider mid-term rentals (30+ days) which are exempt from STR rules.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>What Counts as Principal Residence?</h3>
          <p>Your principal residence is where you normally live, receive mail, file taxes from, and consider your permanent home. The city can verify this through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Property tax records</li>
            <li>Driver's license address</li>
            <li>Utility bills</li>
            <li>Tax filings</li>
            <li>Other government documentation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You cannot simply claim a property is your principal residence. The city has the authority to investigate and can revoke your license if they determine you've misrepresented residency.</p>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>You must obtain a valid STR license before advertising or operating any short-term rental in Oshawa. Here's what you need:</p>

          <h3>License Fees</h3>
          <div class="fee-breakdown">
            <div class="fee-item">
              <span class="fee-label">Application fee</span>
              <span class="fee-amount">$50</span>
            </div>
            <div class="fee-item">
              <span class="fee-label">License fee</span>
              <span class="fee-amount">$100</span>
            </div>
            <div class="fee-item total">
              <span class="fee-label">Total</span>
              <span class="fee-amount">$150</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Application Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing exits, windows, rooms, and common areas (hand-drawn is acceptable)</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of insurance</strong> with minimum $2,000,000 liability coverage that explicitly identifies STR use</li>
            <li><strong>Local contact information</strong> for someone available 24/7 who can respond within one hour</li>
            <li><strong>Declaration</strong> attesting compliance with zoning, safety requirements, and property owner consent</li>
            <li><strong>Condo board approval</strong> if applicable (must confirm STR use is permitted)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>

            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Inspection required:</strong> All STR properties must pass an inspection by City Licensing Inspectors before your license is approved. This is scheduled during the application process.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Insurance Requirements</h3>
          <p>Your insurance policy must meet specific criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum <strong>$2,000,000 liability coverage</strong> per occurrence</li>
            <li>Policy must <strong>explicitly identify STR use</strong></li>
            <li>You must provide <strong>15 days written notice</strong> to the city if insurance is cancelled</li>
            <li>Standard homeowner's insurance typically doesn't cover STR activity</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="night-limits">Night Limits</h2>
          <p>Oshawa imposes two restrictions on how you can rent:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Restriction</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Limit</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Per booking</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">28 consecutive days max</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Per year</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">180 days total</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The 180-night annual limit matches Toronto's regulations. Once you hit 180 nights in a calendar year, you cannot accept additional short-term bookings until the next year.</p>

          <div class="success-box">
            <h4>Tracking Your Nights</h4>
            <p>Keep accurate records of every booking. Most platforms provide annual summaries, but maintain your own spreadsheet as backup. The city can request these records at any time.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="room-rentals">Room Rental Rules</h2>
          <p>If you want to rent individual rooms while remaining in your home, Oshawa has specific restrictions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maximum 2 rooms</strong> can be rented at a time</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum 2 occupants per room</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cannot operate both</strong> whole-home and room rentals simultaneously</li>
            <li>No other rental use permitted in the same dwelling unit</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Room rentals still count toward your 180-night annual limit. Each night a room is rented is one night of your allocation.</p>

          <h2 id="safety-requirements">Safety Requirements</h2>
          <p>Your STR must meet specific safety standards:</p>

          <h3>Mandatory Safety Equipment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Working smoke alarms</strong> on each level of the dwelling</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon monoxide detectors</strong> on all sleeping levels</li>
            <li><strong>Posted emergency instructions</strong> clearly visible to guests</li>
            <li><strong>Visitor's Code</strong> provided to all renters before or at check-in</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Visitor's Code</h3>
          <p>You must provide every guest with a Visitor's Code that outlines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Property rules and expectations</li>
            <li>Emergency contact information</li>
            <li>Relevant city bylaws (noise, parking, garbage)</li>
            <li>Check-out procedures</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Keep confirmation that each renter received the Visitor's Code for your records.</p>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</h2>
          <p>Oshawa implemented a 5% Municipal Accommodation Tax effective October 1, 2024. This applies to all transient accommodations including short-term rentals.</p>

          <div class="key-stats" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">
            <div class="stat-item highlight">

          </div>

          <h3>MAT Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collect 5%</strong> of the purchase price from guests</li>
            <li><strong>Remit quarterly</strong> to the City Treasurer</li>
            <li><strong>Display as separate line item</strong> on receipts/invoices as "Municipal Accommodation Tax"</li>
            <li><strong>Keep records for 7 years</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A Provider identified as a bed and breakfast or short-term rental shall remit the amount of the M.A.T. collected for the previous three months and submit the quarterly statements on or before the last day every calendar quarter end."

          </div>

          <h2 id="compliance">Staying Compliant</h2>
          <p>Oshawa takes enforcement seriously. Here's how to stay on the right side of the bylaw:</p>

          <h3>Record Keeping (6 Years)</h3>
          <p>You must keep detailed records for at least 6 years:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rental dates and number of nights</li>
            <li>Whether whole-home or room rental</li>
            <li>Confirmation renters received Visitor's Code</li>
            <li>MAT collected (keep 7 years for MAT records)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Advertising Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Display your valid license number</strong> on all listings and advertisements</li>
            <li>Cannot advertise an STR without a valid license</li>
            <li>Keep listings accurate and up-to-date</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Local Contact</h3>
          <p>Your designated Local Contact must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be available <strong>24/7</strong></li>
            <li>Respond within <strong>one hour</strong> by phone or email</li>
            <li>Be able to attend the property if needed</li>
            <li>Have authority to resolve issues</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2>
          <p>Oshawa enforces STR regulations with escalating penalties:</p>

          <div class="penalty-box">
            <h4>Penalty Structure</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operating without license:</strong> Up to $500</li>
              <li><strong>Other bylaw violations:</strong> Up to $250</li>
              <li><strong>Provincial Offences Act:</strong> $500 to $100,000</li>

              <li><strong>Unpaid amounts:</strong> Can be added to your property tax bill</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>The city can also revoke or suspend your license for non-compliance. Corporate officers and directors can be held personally liable for violations.</p>
