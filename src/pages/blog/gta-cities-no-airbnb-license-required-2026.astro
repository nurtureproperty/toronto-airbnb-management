  { q: "Can I Airbnb an investment property in Ajax or Pickering?", a: "Yes. Ajax and Pickering have no principal residence requirement, meaning you can operate short-term rentals on investment properties. There's no license fee, no MAT tax, and no night limits." },
  { q: "What happened to Burlington's unregulated status?", a: "Burlington introduced comprehensive STR regulations (By-law 01-2025) effective May 1, 2025. It now requires principal residence, licensing, $2M insurance, and has a 183-night annual limit with a demerit point system. See our Burlington STR guide for full details." },

Ajax and Pickering have not announced plans to regulate. Burlington already introduced regulations in May 2025." },
  { q: "What's the difference between regulated and unregulated cities?", a: "Regulated cities like Toronto require licenses ($58/year), principal residence, MAT tax (8.5%), and 180-night limits. Unregulated cities have none of these requirements, making them more flexible for hosts and investors." },
  { q: "Do I still need insurance in unregulated cities?", a: "Yes. Regardless of city regulations, you should have $2,000,000+ liability insurance that explicitly covers short-term rental activity. Standard homeowner's insurance typically doesn't cover STR guests." },
  { q: "Are there any night limits in these unregulated cities?", a: "No. Unlike Toronto's 180-night limit, cities like Ajax, Pickering, and Richmond Hill have no caps on how many nights you can rent. You can operate year-round without restrictions." },
  { q: "What about condo rules in unregulated cities?", a: "Even in unregulated cities, your condo corporation can prohibit short-term rentals. Always check your condo declaration and rules before listing, regardless of municipal regulations." }

            <p class="lead">While Toronto, Mississauga, and Brampton have strict Airbnb licensing requirements, several GTA cities remain <strong>completely unregulated</strong> for short-term rentals. No license fees. No Municipal Accommodation Tax. No principal residence requirement. Here's where you can still host freely in 2026.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="disclaimer-box">
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Municipal regulations change frequently. Always verify current requirements directly with your local municipality, consult with a legal professional, and check your condo corporation rules before listing a property for short-term rental.
          </div>

          <h2 id="overview">The Unregulated Advantage</h2>
          <p>In regulated cities like Toronto, hosting on Airbnb means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>$58/year license fee plus registration requirements</li>
            <li>8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax on every booking</li>
            <li>180-night annual limit for entire-home rentals</li>
            <li>Principal residence requirement (no investment properties)</li>
            <li>Potential fines up to $100,000 for non-compliance</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In unregulated cities, you face <strong>none of these restrictions</strong>. You can rent investment properties, host year-round with no night limits, keep 100% of your rental income (no MAT), and operate without registering with the city.</p>

            <div class="requirement-item">
              <h4>1. Insurance</h4>
              <p>Get $2,000,000+ liability insurance that explicitly covers short-term rental activity. Standard homeowner's insurance doesn't cover STR guests. Airbnb's Host Protection Insurance is secondary coverage only.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-item">
              <h4>2. Condo Rules</h4>
              <p>Even in unregulated cities, your condo corporation can prohibit STRs. Check your declaration, bylaws, and rules. Get written confirmation if possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-item">
              <h4>3. HST Registration</h4>
              <p>If you earn $30,000+ annually from STRs, you must register for HST and collect 13% on bookings. This applies regardless of municipal regulations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-item">
              <h4>4. Income Tax</h4>
              <p>All rental income must be reported to the CRA. Keep records of income and expenses. The 2024 federal rule denies deductions for non-compliant STRs in regulated areas, but this doesn't apply to unregulated cities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-item">
              <h4>5. Property Standards</h4>
              <p>General property standards, noise bylaws, and parking regulations still apply. Maintain your property and be a good neighbor to avoid complaints.</p>
