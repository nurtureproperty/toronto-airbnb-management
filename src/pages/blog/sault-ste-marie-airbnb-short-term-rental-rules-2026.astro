const faqs = [
  { q: "Do I need to live in the property to run an STR in Sault Ste. Marie?", a: "No! Unlike most Ontario cities, Sault Ste. Marie does NOT have a principal residence requirement. You can operate an STR from an investment property. This makes the Sault one of the most investor-friendly STR markets in Ontario." },
  { q: "How much does the license cost?", a: "$500 per year - significantly higher than the original $50 fee. The increase reflects the city's commitment to proper regulation and enforcement. The license is valid for 3 years, with renewal deadline of March 1st." },
  { q: "What inspections are required?", a: "You need approvals from three city departments: Building Division, Fire Services, and Finance. Each verifies different aspects of compliance - building code, fire safety, and tax/fee requirements respectively." },
  { q: "Do I need a police background check?", a: "Yes. Sault Ste. Marie requires a police background check as part of your license application. This is to ensure operators don't have relevant criminal history that would affect their suitability to host guests." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need?", a: "$2,000,000 liability insurance, and the City must be named as an additional insured on your policy. This is stricter than basic insurance requirements - contact your insurer about adding the municipal endorsement." },
  { q: "Does Airbnb collect the MAT automatically?", a: "Yes. Airbnb and other major platforms collect the 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax on Sault Ste. Marie bookings. For direct bookings, you must collect and remit the 4% yourself." },
  { q: "What's the maximum rental length?", a: "28 consecutive days. Rentals longer than 28 days aren't classified as STRs and have different rules. This is standard across most Ontario municipalities." },
  { q: "Do I need to provide neighbor contact info?", a: "Yes. You must provide contact information to neighbors so they can reach you directly with concerns. This proactive approach helps prevent issues from escalating to formal complaints." }

            <p class="lead">Sault Ste. Marie sits at the heart of the Algoma region, attracting visitors for outdoor recreation, the Agawa Canyon tour, and cross-border travel. As Northern Ontario's third-largest city, it has a growing STR market.</p>
            <p class="lead">What makes the Sault unique? It's one of the few Ontario cities that does NOT require STRs to be in your principal residence. This makes it significantly more investor-friendly than most of the province. Here's the complete guide to operating an STR in the Sault.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Sault Ste. Marie uses a standard 28-day definition:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term rental accommodations means accommodations provided for a period of up to twenty-eight (28) consecutive days."
            <cite>Sault Ste. Marie STR Licensing Guidelines</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Up to 28 days</strong> - standard Ontario threshold</li>
            <li><strong>Accommodations</strong> - residential properties for guest stays</li>
            <li><strong>Consecutive days</strong> - per booking/stay</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial hospitality excluded</strong> - hotels, motels have separate rules</li>
          </ul>

              <strong>29+ day bookings:</strong> Rentals of 29+ consecutive days aren't classified as STRs. They may fall under different regulations or be considered standard rental arrangements.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="no-principal-residence">No Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is what makes Sault Ste. Marie stand out:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "There is no primary residence restriction for short-term rental operators in Sault Ste. Marie."
            <cite>Sault Ste. Marie STR Licensing Guidelines</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>What this means for investors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Investment properties qualify</strong> - unlike Toronto, Ottawa, London, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple STRs allowed</strong> - can operate more than one property</li>
            <li><strong>Out-of-town ownership OK</strong> - don't need to live in the Sault</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate ownership possible</strong> - check specific requirements</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

          <h2 id="background-check">Police Background Check</h2>
          <p>Sault Ste. Marie requires a police background check:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A police background check is required as part of the short-term rental license application."
            <cite>Sault Ste. Marie STR Licensing Guidelines</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This requirement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Must be obtained locally</strong> - from Sault Ste. Marie Police Service</li>
            <li><strong>Verifies suitability</strong> - ensures no relevant criminal history</li>
            <li><strong>Required for all applicants</strong> - owner/operator must submit</li>
            <li><strong>Processing time varies</strong> - apply early</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Sault Ste. Marie has strict insurance requirements:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Operators must maintain liability insurance of at least $2,000,000 and must name the City as an additional insured on the policy."
            <cite>Sault Ste. Marie STR Licensing Guidelines</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>

            <li><strong>$2,000,000 minimum</strong> liability coverage</li>
            <li><strong>City as additional insured</strong> - requires specific policy endorsement</li>
            <li><strong>Certificate required</strong> with application</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain continuously</strong> throughout license term</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Additional Insured Requirement</h4>
            <p>The requirement to name the City as an "additional insured" is stricter than basic insurance. Not all policies support this endorsement. Contact your insurer early - you may need specialized STR insurance to comply.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="neighbor-contact">Neighbor Notification Requirement</h2>
          <p>Sault Ste. Marie takes a proactive approach to neighbor relations:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Operators must provide contact information to neighbors so they can be reached directly with any concerns."
            <cite>Sault Ste. Marie STR Licensing Guidelines</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This requirement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Give neighbors your contact info</strong> before operating</li>
            <li><strong>Enables direct communication</strong> - issues resolved before escalation</li>
            <li><strong>Builds community relationships</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Reduces formal complaints</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</h2>
          <p>Sault Ste. Marie charges 4% MAT:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">

          <p>For platform bookings, the 4% MAT is typically collected automatically. For direct bookings, you're responsible for collecting from guests and remitting to the City.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Sault Ste. Marie</h2>
          <p>Even with more relaxed rules, compliance matters. Here's how to succeed:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Get your background check early.</strong> Processing times vary. Don't let this delay your application - submit the request as soon as you decide to pursue an STR license.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Schedule all three inspections.</strong> Building, Fire, and Finance approvals are all required. Contact each department to understand their process and timeline.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Get proper insurance immediately.</strong> The "City as additional insured" requirement is specific. Contact insurers who specialize in STR coverage - standard homeowner's policies likely won't work.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Reach out to neighbors proactively.</strong> Before your first guest arrives, introduce yourself to neighbors and provide your contact information. This builds goodwill and prevents surprises.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Display your license number.</strong> Like most municipalities, your license number must appear on all listings and advertisements.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Create clear house rules.</strong> You're required to have house rules for guests. Cover quiet hours, parking, garbage, and other potential friction points.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Remember the March 1st renewal.</strong> Your 3-year license has a specific renewal deadline. Mark it well in advance - operating on an expired license is operating illegally.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Keep records.</strong> Maintain documentation of all bookings, guest communications, and compliance activities. You may need to produce these for city officials.</li>
          </ul>
