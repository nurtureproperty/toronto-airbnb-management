const faqs = [
  { q: "Is it legal to take direct bookings instead of using Airbnb?", a: "Yes, completely legal. You're free to rent your property to guests through any channel, including your own website. The same municipal bylaws apply regardless of whether guests find you on Airbnb or your personal site. You still need an STR license (where required), must collect MAT, and follow all local regulations." },
  { q: "How much does it cost to build a direct booking website?", a: "Anywhere from $0 to $100/month depending on your approach. A basic Carrd or WordPress site costs under $20/month. Dedicated hospitality platforms like Lodgify or Hospitable run $30 to $80/month but include channel management, payment processing, and automated messaging. Most hosts start with a simple one-page site and upgrade as direct bookings grow." },
  { q: "How do I handle payment processing for direct bookings?", a: "Stripe is the most popular option for Canadian hosts. It charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, which is still far less than Airbnb's 14-20% combined fees. Square and PayPal are alternatives. Most hospitality booking platforms (Lodgify, Hostaway) include built-in payment processing through Stripe integration." },
  { q: "Do I lose Airbnb's insurance when I take direct bookings?", a: "Yes. AirCover only applies to bookings made through Airbnb. For direct bookings, you need your own short-term rental insurance policy. Canadian options include Duuo (pay-per-night), APOLLO, and Square One. A typical policy costs $3 to $8 per booked night, which is still cheaper than what you save on Airbnb fees." },
  { q: "How do I screen guests without Airbnb's review system?", a: "Use third-party guest screening tools like Autohost, Guest Ranger, or Superhog. These services verify government ID, run background checks, and assess risk. Many hosts also require a signed rental agreement, a security deposit, and a brief phone call before confirming any direct booking." },
  { q: "Should I stop listing on Airbnb entirely?", a: "No. The best strategy is to use Airbnb as a discovery channel while building your direct booking funnel. Keep your Airbnb listing active to attract new guests, then convert them to direct rebookers after their first stay. Most successful hosts get 20-40% of bookings directly within 12 to 18 months." },
  { q: "Can I contact past Airbnb guests to offer direct rebooking?", a: "You cannot solicit bookings from guests while an Airbnb reservation is active. However, after checkout, many hosts include a thank-you card or follow-up email with their direct booking website. Airbnb's terms don't prohibit guests from independently choosing to book directly for future stays." },
  { q: "What's the biggest risk of direct bookings?", a: "The biggest risk is inadequate guest screening and missing insurance coverage. On Airbnb, reviews and AirCover provide a safety net. Without those, you need to build your own screening process and carry proper STR insurance. Done correctly, the financial savings far outweigh the extra effort." }

            <p class="lead">Every time a guest books through Airbnb, <strong>the platform takes 14-20% of what they pay.</strong> That's the host service fee (3%) plus the guest service fee (14-20%) that inflates your nightly rate and pushes price-sensitive travelers elsewhere. A direct booking website lets you keep that money, build relationships with guests, and stop depending on a single platform for your income.</p>
            <p>This guide covers everything: how to build your site, re-engage past guests, screen travelers without Airbnb's review system, handle insurance, and process payments. Whether you're managing one condo in Toronto or five properties across the GTA, a direct booking channel is the single biggest lever for increasing your take-home revenue.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="why-direct-bookings">Why Direct Bookings Matter</h2>
          <p>Let's talk about what Airbnb actually costs you. Most hosts focus on the 3% host service fee, but that's only half the picture.</p>

          <div class="fee-breakdown">
            <h4>The True Cost of an Airbnb Booking</h4>
            <div class="fee-items">
              <div class="fee-item">
                <span class="fee-label">Guest pays</span>

              </div>

                <span class="fee-label">Airbnb guest service fee (14%)</span>
                <span class="fee-value negative">$28</span>
              </div>
              <div class="fee-item">
                <span class="fee-label">Airbnb host service fee (3%)</span>
                <span class="fee-value negative">$6</span>
              </div>
              <div class="fee-item total">
                <span class="fee-label">Total Airbnb take</span>
                <span class="fee-value negative">$34/night</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="fee-note">On a property booked 200 nights per year at $200/night, that's <strong>$6,800 annually</strong> going to Airbnb.</p>
          </div>

          <p>But fees are only part of the story. Here's why direct bookings change the game:</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>You Own the Relationship</h4>
              <p>Airbnb controls the guest relationship. They can change search rankings, adjust policies, or suspend your account at any time. With direct bookings, you build a guest database that no algorithm change can take away.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Higher Perceived Value</h4>
              <p>Without the guest service fee, your $200/night property costs the guest $200, not $228. You can charge $210 directly, and the guest still saves money while you pocket an extra $10/night.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Repeat Guest Revenue</h4>
              <p>Acquiring a new guest through Airbnb costs you ~17% in fees every time. A repeat guest who books directly costs you nothing beyond payment processing (2.9%). That's the difference between 83% and 97% of revenue in your pocket.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Platform Diversification</h4>
              <p>Hosts who rely 100% on Airbnb are one policy change away from disaster. Remember when Airbnb <a href="/blog/airbnb-superhost-guide-2026">changed Superhost requirements</a>? A direct channel gives you a safety net.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">

              <strong>The Math:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">If you convert just 30% of your bookings to direct within a year, a property grossing $60,000 annually on Airbnb would save you roughly $3,000 to $4,000 in platform fees. That's a vacation fund just from building a simple website.</p>

          <h2 id="build-your-site">How to Build Your Direct Booking Site</h2>
          <p>You don't need to be a web developer. The hospitality industry has dozens of tools built specifically for hosts who want to accept direct bookings. Here are your main options, ranked from simplest to most powerful.</p>

          <div class="table-container">
            <table class="data-table">

          <h3>What Your Direct Booking Site Needs</h3>
          <p>Guests book directly when trust is high and friction is low. Your site needs to answer every question a potential guest would have, because there's no Airbnb review count backing you up.</p>

          <div class="tips-list">
            <div class="tip-item">
              <span class="tip-number">1</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Professional Photos</strong>
                <p>Use the same <a href="/blog/airbnb-photography-guide-toronto-2026">professional photography</a> from your Airbnb listing. If anything, add more photos than Airbnb allows. Include neighborhood shots, nearby restaurants, and seasonal views.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
              <span class="tip-number">2</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Real-Time Calendar</strong>
                <p>Nothing kills a direct booking faster than "I'll check if those dates are available." Use a booking engine that syncs with your Airbnb calendar via iCal or API so guests can see live availability and book instantly.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
              <span class="tip-number">3</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Reviews and Social Proof</strong>
                <p>Import your Airbnb reviews. Most booking platforms let you display testimonials. Screenshot your best Airbnb reviews and feature them prominently. A 4.9 star rating with 50+ reviews is your most powerful trust signal.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
              <span class="tip-number">4</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Clear Pricing and Policies</strong>
                <p>Display nightly rates, cleaning fees, security deposits, and cancellation policies upfront. Transparency builds trust. Guests who book directly expect to save money compared to Airbnb, so show them the savings explicitly.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
              <span class="tip-number">5</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Secure Payment Processing</strong>
                <p>Stripe is the gold standard. PCI-compliant, guest-friendly, and integrates with every major booking platform. Never accept e-transfers or cash for first-time direct bookings.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="reengage-past-guests">Re-Engaging Past Guests</h2>
          <p>Your best direct booking prospects are people who've already stayed with you. They know your property, they've experienced your hospitality, and they don't need convincing. The question is: how do you get them to book directly next time?</p>

          <h3>Collecting Contact Info (The Right Way)</h3>
          <p>Airbnb doesn't share guest email addresses during a booking, but there are legitimate ways to build your guest database.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Welcome book with QR code:</strong> Include a physical <a href="/blog/airbnb-welcome-book-template-guide-2026">welcome book</a> in your property with a QR code linking to your direct booking site. Add a "Book your next stay and save 10%" message next to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-stay thank you:</strong> After checkout, send a message through Airbnb thanking them for their stay. Include your business name (which they can easily Google to find your direct site).</li>
            <li><strong>Departure gift or card:</strong> Leave a small thank-you card at checkout with your website URL and a discount code for their next visit. Something like "Save 15% on your next Toronto stay" with your direct booking URL.</li>
            <li><strong>WiFi captive portal:</strong> Set up your WiFi to show a landing page before connecting. Guests enter their email to get the WiFi password. You now have their email for future marketing (with consent).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Email Sequences That Convert</h3>
          <p>Once you have a guest's email (with permission), send them a simple sequence:</p>

          <div class="sequence-box">
            <div class="sequence-item">
              <span class="sequence-num">Day 1</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Thank You + Review Request</strong>
                <p>Thank them, ask for an Airbnb review, mention your direct booking site casually.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sequence-item">
              <span class="sequence-num">Month 3</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Seasonal Update</strong>
                <p>"Toronto is stunning in the fall. Book direct and save 10% on your next stay." Include a link to your site with seasonal photos.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sequence-item">
              <span class="sequence-num">Month 6</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Loyalty Offer</strong>
                <p>"It's been 6 months! As a returning guest, here's an exclusive rate." Offer 15% off or a free late checkout.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sequence-item">
              <span class="sequence-num">Anniversary</span>
              <div>
                <strong>Personal Touch</strong>
                <p>"Happy anniversary of your Toronto trip! Ready for round two?" This works surprisingly well for guests who visited for special occasions.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="referral-engine">Building a Referral Engine</h2>
          <p>Happy guests talk. The question is whether they're sending friends to Airbnb (where you pay fees on every new booking) or to your direct site (where you don't). A simple referral program tips the scales in your favor.</p>

          <h3>How to Set Up Referrals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Referral discount codes:</strong> Give each guest a unique code that saves their friend 10% and earns the referrer a 10% credit on their next stay. Tools like Lodgify and Hospitable support this natively.</li>
            <li><strong>Business cards in the property:</strong> Leave a small stack of cards near the entrance or in the welcome book. "Love your stay? Share this with a friend" with your website and a referral code.</li>
            <li><strong>QR codes everywhere:</strong> On the fridge, in the bathroom mirror, on the bedside table. Each one links to your direct booking site. Make them small and tasteful, not obnoxious. (What do QR codes and good hosts have in common? They both make connections.)</li>
            <li><strong>Google reviews:</strong> Ask guests to leave a Google review for your property. This boosts your local SEO and drives organic traffic to your direct booking site.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="get-traffic">Getting Eyes on Your Direct Booking Site</h2>
          <p>Building a website is step one. Getting people to find it is step two. Here are the channels that work best for short-term rental hosts in the GTA.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Google Business Profile</h4>
              <p>Create a Google Business Profile for your rental property. It's free, shows up in local searches ("Airbnb near CN Tower"), and lets guests find your direct booking site through Google Maps. Include photos, reviews, and your booking URL.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Instagram and Social Media</h4>
              <p>Post property photos, local recommendations, and guest experiences. Use location tags (#TorontoAirbnb, #GTATravel). Bio link goes to your direct booking site. Stories showing behind-the-scenes hosting content build trust and personality.</p>

          <h3>Keep Your Airbnb Listing Active</h3>
          <p>This is important: <strong>don't abandon Airbnb.</strong> Use it as your top-of-funnel discovery channel. New guests find you on Airbnb, have a great experience, and then rebook directly next time. Think of Airbnb as your customer acquisition cost, and your direct site as where the real profit lives.</p>

          <p>List on <a href="/blog/airbnb-vrbo-booking-multi-platform-guide-2026">multiple platforms</a> (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com) to maximize discovery, then funnel everyone toward direct rebooking after their first stay.</p>

          <h2 id="guest-screening">Guest Screening Without Airbnb's Safety Net</h2>
          <p>This is the section that makes hosts nervous. On Airbnb, you have reviews, verified IDs, and AirCover as a backstop. With direct bookings, you need to build your own <a href="/blog/airbnb-guest-screening-party-prevention-guide-2026">screening process</a>. The good news: dedicated screening tools are actually more thorough than Airbnb's built-in protections.</p>

          <h3>Your Direct Booking Screening Checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Government ID verification:</strong> Require a photo of a valid government ID before confirming any booking. Tools like Autohost automate this and flag suspicious documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Signed rental agreement:</strong> Draft a simple rental agreement covering house rules, noise policies, maximum occupancy, security deposit terms, and liability. This is legally enforceable and deters bad actors.</li>
            <li><strong>Security deposit:</strong> Hold a $250 to $500 security deposit via Stripe's authorization hold (no charge unless damage occurs). Guests expect this for direct bookings.</li>
            <li><strong>Phone call for first-time guests:</strong> A 5-minute phone call eliminates 95% of problematic bookings. Ask about the purpose of their trip, how many guests, and any special requests. Legitimate guests are happy to chat.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart lock monitoring:</strong> Use <a href="/blog/best-smart-locks-airbnb-check-in-2026">smart locks</a> with occupancy alerts. Unusual access patterns (10 people checking in when 2 were booked) trigger immediate notification.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance for Direct Bookings</h2>
          <p>When guests book through Airbnb, AirCover provides up to $3 million in damage protection (with conditions). When they book directly, <strong>you have zero platform coverage.</strong> You need your own <a href="/blog/airbnb-insurance-ontario-host-guide-2026">short-term rental insurance</a>.</p>

              <strong>Do Not Skip This:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Your standard homeowner's insurance does NOT cover short-term rental activity. If a guest slips and falls, your homeowner's policy will likely deny the claim because you were operating a commercial activity. Get STR-specific coverage before accepting your first direct booking.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Canadian STR Insurance Options</h3>
          <div class="info-grid three-col">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Duuo</h4>
              <p>Pay-per-night insurance designed for Canadian STR hosts. Only pay for nights you're booked. Covers liability, property damage, and loss of income. Starts around $5/night.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>APOLLO Insurance</h4>
              <p>Canadian insurer offering STR coverage as a rider on your homeowner's policy. Annual premium, simpler to manage if you have consistent bookings. Covers liability up to $2M.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Square One</h4>
              <p>Offers a short-term rental endorsement for their home insurance policies. Good option if you're already a Square One customer. Covers property damage and liability.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Most Ontario municipalities that regulate STRs require $2,000,000 in liability insurance. Even if your city doesn't require it, carry it anyway. One slip-and-fall lawsuit could cost more than a lifetime of insurance premiums.</p>

          <h2 id="payment-processing">Payment Processing</h2>
          <p>Handling money without Airbnb acting as intermediary means you need a proper payment system. Here's what works for Canadian hosts.</p>

          <h3>Recommended: Stripe</h3>
          <p>Stripe is the standard for direct booking payments. It integrates with Lodgify, Hospitable, Hostaway, and most booking platforms. The fees are straightforward: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. On a $1,000 booking, that's $29.30 instead of the $170+ Airbnb would take.</p>

          <h3>Key Payment Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collect payment at booking confirmation</strong>, not at check-in. This reduces no-shows and secures your revenue.</li>
            <li><strong>Use authorization holds for security deposits.</strong> Stripe lets you place a hold on a guest's card without actually charging it. If no damage, the hold releases automatically after checkout.</li>
            <li><strong>Issue proper receipts.</strong> Your booking platform should handle this, but make sure every guest gets an itemized receipt showing nightly rate, cleaning fee, taxes, and total.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation policy:</strong> Define clear terms. A common structure: full refund 14+ days before check-in, 50% refund 7 to 13 days, no refund within 7 days. Display this on your booking page.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid e-transfers for strangers.</strong> E-transfers are fine for repeat guests you trust, but new direct bookings should always go through a proper payment processor for dispute protection.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"></line>
                <line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"></line>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>HST Reminder:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">If your total STR revenue (all channels combined) exceeds $30,000/year, you must register for and charge HST (13%). Airbnb handles this automatically on their platform, but for direct bookings, you're responsible for collecting and remitting HST yourself. Keep clean records.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="when-it-makes-sense">When Direct Booking Makes Sense (and When It Doesn't)</h2>
          <p>Direct bookings aren't for everyone. Here's an honest breakdown of when the effort pays off and when you're better off sticking to platforms.</p>

          <div class="comparison-box">
            <div class="comparison-column good">
              <h4>Direct Booking Works Great When...</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>You have a high repeat guest rate (20%+ of guests return)</li>
                <li>Your property is unique or premium (guests seek it out specifically)</li>
                <li>You host <a href="/blog/mid-term-rentals-toronto-guide-2026">mid-term guests</a> (30+ day stays, higher lifetime value)</li>
                <li>You have a local network (corporate contacts, wedding venues, relocation firms)</li>
                <li>You manage 3+ properties and want to reduce per-booking costs</li>
                <li>You're comfortable with guest screening and carry your own insurance</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-column caution">
              <h4>Stick to Airbnb If...</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>You're a brand new host with no reviews yet</li>
                <li>Your occupancy rate is below 50% (you need the exposure)</li>
                <li>You don't want to handle payment processing or guest screening</li>
                <li>Your property is in a competitive market where Airbnb's audience is essential</li>
                <li>You're not willing to invest time in marketing or guest relationship building</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The sweet spot for most GTA hosts? <strong>Start on Airbnb, build reviews and a guest base, then gradually shift 20-40% of bookings to direct over 12 to 18 months.</strong> You're not replacing Airbnb. You're reducing your dependency on it.</p>
