const faqs = [
  { q: "How long do I have to file an Airbnb damage claim?", a: "You must file your damage claim within 14 days of guest checkout or before the next guest checks in, whichever comes first. Missing this window means you forfeit your ability to claim through the Resolution Center and AirCover. This is why immediate documentation at every checkout is critical." },
  { q: "What does AirCover for Hosts actually cover?", a: "AirCover for Hosts provides up to $3 million USD in damage protection for damage to your home, furnishings, and belongings caused by guests. It also includes $1 million in liability protection. However, it excludes cash and securities, normal wear and tear, pets (unless you allow pets and document damage), shared or common spaces in buildings, some electronics without receipts, and damage to property not on your listing." },
  { q: "Does Airbnb still hold security deposits?", a: "No. Airbnb eliminated traditional security deposits in 2022. Instead, Airbnb relies on AirCover for Hosts and the Resolution Center process to handle damage. Hosts cannot require guests to put down a refundable deposit before booking. The Resolution Center is now the primary mechanism for recovering costs from damage." },
  { q: "What if a guest denies causing the damage?", a: "If a guest denies the damage claim, you escalate to Airbnb after 24 hours (or after the guest declines). Airbnb's Trust and Safety team reviews both sides and makes a determination. This is where your documentation becomes decisive: timestamped before-and-after photos, cleaning team reports, and any guest communications where damage is acknowledged carry significant weight." },
  { q: "What types of damage are hardest to claim successfully?", a: "Missing items are the most difficult because you need a documented inventory list to prove what was there before the stay. Gradual damage that builds up over multiple stays is also challenging, since you need to tie specific damage to a specific booking. Damage in shared or common building areas is excluded from AirCover entirely. Claims without before photos are very difficult to win." },
  { q: "When should I use my own insurance instead of AirCover?", a: "Consider filing with your own short-term rental insurance for claims over $5,000, claims that AirCover has denied, complex situations involving liability to third parties, or damage types that AirCover explicitly excludes. Always check whether AirCover will cover the claim first, as some insurers require proof of denial before paying out." },
  { q: "Can I file a damage claim if I have a property manager?", a: "Yes. If you use a property manager like Nurture, the manager can file claims on your behalf. In fact, professional managers typically maintain better documentation systems than self-managing hosts, including timestamped photo libraries, cleaning team check-in reports, and organized receipt databases. This often results in higher claim success rates." },
  { q: "Does filing damage claims affect my Airbnb standing as a host?", a: "Filing legitimate damage claims does not negatively affect your Superhost status or search ranking. Airbnb's system is designed for this purpose. However, repeatedly filing frivolous or unsubstantiated claims could trigger review. Claims filed with solid documentation and for genuine damage are a normal and expected part of hosting." }

            <p class="lead">Guest damage is one of the most stressful parts of hosting. <strong>Most hosts who lose damage claims don't lose because the damage wasn't real. They lose because they didn't document it properly or missed the filing deadline.</strong> This guide walks through exactly how Airbnb's Resolution Center works, what AirCover actually covers (and what it doesn't), and how to build a documentation system that wins claims consistently.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="how-resolution-center-works">How the Airbnb Resolution Center Works</h2>
          <p>The Resolution Center is Airbnb's built-in system for resolving financial disputes between hosts and guests, including damage claims, additional cleaning fees, and other charges outside the original booking price. Understanding the process before you need it is essential.</p>

          <p>The process runs in a specific sequence. You must request payment from the guest first, and only after the guest declines or fails to respond can you escalate to Airbnb for review. Skipping steps or filing out of order will delay or invalidate your claim.</p>

              <strong>Key Rule:</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">You must file your claim within 14 days of checkout or before the next guest checks in, whichever comes first. This is a hard deadline. No exceptions. Document damage the moment your cleaner finds it.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>The Resolution Center Sequence</h3>
          <p>Here is how a typical damage claim moves through Airbnb's system from start to finish:</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Damage Discovered at Checkout</h4>
              <p>Your cleaner discovers damage during the turnover. They photograph everything immediately with timestamps and report to you before touching anything that could be considered evidence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Open a Resolution Request</h4>
              <p>Navigate to the Airbnb Resolution Center from your hosting dashboard. Select the specific booking, itemize each damaged item with photos, descriptions, and replacement or repair costs.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="alternatives-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Guest Responds (24-Hour Window)</h4>
              <p>Airbnb notifies the guest, who has 24 hours to respond. They can pay the full amount, pay a partial amount, or decline. If they don't respond within 24 hours, you can involve Airbnb.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Involve Airbnb if Needed</h4>
              <p>If the guest declines or disputes the amount, click "Involve Airbnb." This escalates the claim to Airbnb's Trust and Safety team, who review the evidence from both sides.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="alternatives-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">5</span>
              <h4>Airbnb Reviews the Claim</h4>
              <p>Airbnb's team reviews your photos, receipts, communication records, and the guest's response. This typically takes 5 to 10 business days. They may request additional documentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">6</span>
              <h4>Decision and Payout</h4>
              <p>Airbnb makes a final determination. If approved, the amount is charged to the guest's payment method or covered by AirCover. Payouts typically appear within 5 to 7 business days of the decision.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="aircover-limits">AirCover for Hosts: What It Covers and What It Doesn't</h2>
          <p>AirCover for Hosts is Airbnb's damage protection program, included at no cost with every hosting account. It provides significant coverage, but it is not a replacement for proper host insurance and has meaningful exclusions every host should understand before relying on it.</p>

          <h3>What AirCover Covers</h3>
          <div class="table-container">
            <table class="rules-table">

          <h3>AirCover Exclusions: What Is Not Covered</h3>
          <p>This is where many hosts are surprised. AirCover has significant exclusions that can leave you without recourse for certain types of damage. Know these before you need them.</p>

              <strong>No Traditional Security Deposits</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Airbnb eliminated traditional security deposits in 2022. You can no longer require guests to hold a refundable deposit before booking. The Resolution Center and AirCover are now the primary tools for recovering damage costs. This makes documentation even more critical, since there is no deposit buffer to draw from immediately.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="timeline-requirements">Timeline Requirements: Don't Miss the Window</h2>
          <p>The 14-day rule is the most commonly violated requirement in damage claims. Many hosts discover damage, intend to file, and then get caught up in the next guest's arrival or day-to-day management tasks. By the time they return to the claim, the window has closed.</p>

          <p>The rule is precise: you must file your claim within 14 days of checkout or before the next guest checks in, whichever comes first. If you have back-to-back bookings with only a few hours between guests, that window can close before checkout day ends.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Scenario A: Back-to-Back Bookings</h4>
              <p>Guest A checks out Sunday at 11am. Guest B checks in Sunday at 4pm. Your claim window for Guest A's damage closes at 4pm Sunday. You have five hours to document and file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Scenario B: Gap Between Guests</h4>
              <p>Guest checks out Friday. Next guest checks in 10 days later. Your window is the full 14 days from checkout, not the gap. File as soon as damage is discovered.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Scenario C: No Next Booking</h4>
              <p>No future guests booked. Your window is 14 days from checkout. File within 24 to 48 hours of discovering damage while evidence is fresh and the guest remembers the stay.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Build a standing policy: damage discovered during turnover gets reported and photographed within the same hour. File the Resolution Center claim on the same day. Do not wait until you receive repair quotes or replacement invoices. You can update the claim with additional documentation after filing.</p>

          <h2 id="documentation">Documentation Best Practices</h2>
          <p>Your photos and records are your entire case. Airbnb's team cannot visit your property, so they make their decision based entirely on the documentation you provide. A claim with 30 timestamped photos and receipts will succeed where a claim with three blurry smartphone pictures will not.</p>

          <h3>The Before/After Photo System</h3>
          <p>Every single turnover should include a complete before photo set taken after cleaning and before the next guest arrives. This is your evidence that the property was in good condition before each specific stay. Without before photos, you cannot prove a guest caused damage rather than a previous guest or normal use.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Take 20 to 30 photos per turnover.</strong> Cover every room, every piece of furniture, walls, floors, appliances, linens, and any item of value. More is always better.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your phone's native camera.</strong> Smartphone cameras embed timestamps and GPS data automatically in the file metadata. This timestamp is admissible evidence in a claim.</li>
            <li><strong>Take video walkthroughs as well.</strong> A 3 to 5 minute walkthrough video of the entire property before and after each stay provides comprehensive evidence that photos alone cannot match.</li>
            <li><strong>Photograph the same spots consistently.</strong> Use the same angles and positions each time so before/after comparisons are clear and undeniable.</li>
            <li><strong>Store photos organized by booking.</strong> Label folders with the booking date and guest name. Airbnb may request before photos from a prior stay to prove the damage is new.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Keep Receipts for Everything</h3>
          <p>Airbnb's AirCover pays replacement cost, not sentimental value. To claim replacement cost on any item, you need documentation of its purchase price. Set up a simple system now, before you need it.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Keep digital receipts for all furniture, appliances, linens, and decor in a dedicated folder</li>
            <li>Photograph item tags or model numbers for higher-value items</li>
            <li>If you no longer have the receipt, a current online listing for the same or equivalent item serves as a replacement cost reference</li>
            <li>For custom or vintage items, a professional appraisal or comparable sale documentation works</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Your Cleaning Team as Witnesses</h3>
          <p>Your cleaners are often the first people in the property after a guest leaves. Their observations carry significant weight in a claim. Establish a clear damage reporting protocol with your cleaning team before any damage occurs.</p>

              <strong>Cleaning Team Protocol</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Instruct your cleaners to: (1) photograph any damage immediately before cleaning or moving anything, (2) text you photos and a written description within 30 minutes of arrival, (3) preserve any physical evidence (broken items, stained linens) until you confirm you don't need them. This written report from a third party strengthens your claim significantly.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Guest Communication Records</h3>
          <p>If a guest messages you acknowledging the damage during or after their stay, screenshot and save that conversation immediately. An admission from the guest, even a vague one like "sorry about the mess we left," is powerful supporting evidence. All messages sent through Airbnb's platform are already logged, but screenshot them as a backup regardless.</p>

          <h2 id="filing-step-by-step">Step-by-Step Claim Filing</h2>
          <p>Here is the exact process for filing a claim through the Resolution Center, from login to payout.</p>

              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Access the Resolution Center</h4>
              <p>Log into your Airbnb host account. Go to your Inbox or Reservations, find the booking in question, then navigate to the Resolution Center. You can also access it directly from airbnb.com/resolutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Select "Request Money"</h4>
              <p>Choose "Request money" from the options and select the relevant booking from your reservations list. Confirm this is the correct guest and stay before proceeding.</p>

              <h4>Select Damage as the Reason</h4>
              <p>Choose "Damage to my property" as the reason for the request. You will be asked to specify whether you are claiming under AirCover or requesting a reimbursement from the guest directly.</p>

              <span class="alt-number">4</span>

              <p>List each damaged item separately with a clear description, the replacement or repair cost, and the supporting evidence. Separate line items are clearer and more credible than a single lump sum. Upload your before/after photos and any receipts directly in this step.</p>

              <h4>Submit and Notify the Guest</h4>
              <p>Submit the request. Airbnb automatically notifies the guest via the platform. The guest has 24 hours to respond. Do not contact the guest outside the platform about the claim during this period.</p>
            </div>

              <p>If the guest declines or fails to respond within 24 hours, click "Involve Airbnb." Upload any additional documentation you have. Airbnb will review within 5 to 10 business days and contact both parties for more information if needed.</p>

          <h3>Party Damage: A Special Case</h3>
          <p>Party damage can be the most severe and the most difficult to claim without proper evidence. If you suspect a party occurred, document everything before cleaning. If the damage is significant, contact local police to file a report before anything is cleaned or removed. A police report number attached to your AirCover claim substantially strengthens your position. Consider using Airbnb's party monitoring tool or a noise detection device like NoiseAware or Minut, whose data logs can serve as supporting evidence in a claim.</p>

          <h2 id="own-insurance">When to Use Your Own Insurance Instead</h2>
          <p>AirCover is your first line of defense, but it is not your only option. There are situations where <a href="/blog/airbnb-insurance-ontario-host-guide-2026">your own short-term rental insurance</a> is the better or only path to recovery.</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Claims Over $5,000</h4>
              <p>While AirCover's limit is $3M USD, large complex claims can face delays or partial approval. Your own insurer may process major structural damage or total loss claims more efficiently and with less dispute.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>AirCover Denial</h4>
              <p>If Airbnb denies your claim or approves a significantly lower amount than requested, your own insurance is the next step. Some policies require you to attempt AirCover first and provide the denial documentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Excluded Damage Types</h4>
              <p>Damage that AirCover explicitly excludes, such as pet damage on a pet-friendly listing or theft of cash, may be covered under your own host insurance policy depending on your coverage.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="info-grid" style="margin-top: 0;">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Liability to Third Parties</h4>
              <p>If a guest injures a neighbor or damages a neighboring property, and the amount or complexity exceeds AirCover's scope, your own liability coverage becomes important. AirCover's $1M liability limit may be insufficient for serious incidents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Complex or Extended Claims</h4>
              <p>Situations that require ongoing coverage, such as a property that must remain vacant during extended repairs, often need dedicated insurance handling rather than a one-time AirCover payout.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Standard Homeowner's Insurance Gap</h4>
              <p>Be aware that most standard homeowner's insurance policies in Ontario explicitly exclude short-term rental damage. You need a specific STR endorsement or standalone host policy to be protected outside of AirCover.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The right approach is to file with AirCover first for guest-caused damage and escalate to your own insurer for situations outside AirCover's scope or for denied claims. Having both layers of protection is the professional standard for serious hosts.</p>

          <h2 id="prevention">Prevention: The Best Damage Strategy</h2>
          <p>The most effective damage management strategy is avoiding damage in the first place. <a href="/blog/airbnb-guest-screening-party-prevention-guide-2026">Thorough guest screening</a> and clear house rules eliminate most damage scenarios before they occur.</p>

          <h3>Guest Screening</h3>
          <p>Airbnb provides guest profiles with reviews from previous hosts. Read them. A guest with multiple stays and positive reviews is statistically far less likely to cause damage than a new account with no reviews. Require ID verification for all guests. For higher-risk periods like long weekends and holidays, consider requiring established accounts with a minimum number of positive reviews.</p>

          <p>Communicate with every guest before they arrive. A brief welcome message asking them to confirm they have read your house rules serves two purposes: it establishes that they were aware of the rules, and it gives you a read on the guest before they arrive.</p>

          <h3>Clear House Rules</h3>
          <p>Every restriction you want to enforce must be explicitly stated in your house rules on the listing. "No parties" must be written in house rules to be enforceable in a claim. "No smoking" must be stated to claim smoking damage. "No pets" must be explicit to claim unauthorized pet damage. Review your house rules and close any gaps.</p>

          <h3>Noise Monitoring Devices</h3>
          <p>Devices like NoiseAware and Minut detect elevated noise levels and alert you in real time without recording audio (which would violate privacy rules). Mentioning a noise monitor in your listing discourages parties. The data logs from these devices have been accepted as supporting evidence in Airbnb claims where party damage occurred.</p>

          <h3>Property Setup</h3>
          <p>Reduce the risk of accidental damage through thoughtful property setup. Use washable slipcovers on sofas. Store irreplaceable or sentimental items off-site. Choose furnishings in dark or patterned fabrics that don't show stains. Provide adequate lighting so guests can see what they're doing. Use smart locks instead of physical keys. A property designed with hosting in mind sustains less damage and recovers faster when damage does occur.</p>
