const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Ottawa?", a: "No. Ottawa requires STRs to be in your principal residence - the home where you normally live. Investment properties don't qualify. The exception is if you own a rural cottage in specific zones, but investment condos and urban properties must be your primary home." },
  { q: "What's the maximum number of guests I can host?", a: "8 overnight guests in a standard dwelling, or 10 guests if you have an oversize dwelling (as defined in the by-law). During events, you can have additional daytime guests, but overnight stays are capped at these numbers." },
  { q: "How much does an Ottawa STR permit cost?", a: "The host permit costs $123 total ($65 administrative fee + $58 permit fee) and is valid for 2 years. You'll need to renew before it expires. Additionally, platforms like Airbnb must register with the city." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need for Ottawa STR?", a: "$1,000,000 liability insurance minimum that specifically covers short-term rental activities. Standard homeowner's insurance typically won't cover STR guests, so you'll need specialized coverage or a rider." },
  { q: "Does Airbnb collect the MAT tax automatically?", a: "Yes. Major platforms like Airbnb are required to register with Ottawa and collect the 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax on your behalf. They remit it directly to the city, so you don't need to handle it separately for platform bookings." },
  { q: "What about my cottage in rural Ottawa?", a: "Good news - Ottawa has a 'cottage rental' exception for rural zones. If your cottage is in a designated rural area and isn't your principal residence, you may still be able to rent it short-term. Check with the city to confirm your zone qualifies." },
  { q: "How quickly do I need to respond to complaints?", a: "You or your designated contact must be reachable 24/7 and able to respond to urgent issues promptly. The by-law requires you to address nuisance complaints within a reasonable timeframe or face penalties." },
  { q: "What records do I need to keep?", a: "Keep records of all rentals including guest names, dates, and any incidents. You may be required to produce these records for city inspectors. Keep them for at least 2 years after each rental." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Ottawa is Canada's capital, attracting millions of visitors annually for government business, tourism, and major events like Winterlude. That creates steady demand for short-term rentals year-round.</p>
            <p class="lead">The city implemented comprehensive STR regulations through By-law 2021-104 in July 2022. It's one of Ontario's more detailed frameworks, covering everything from host permits to platform registration requirements. Here's the complete breakdown.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Ottawa's definition is specific about what qualifies:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-term rental means temporary accommodation in all or part of a dwelling unit for less than thirty (30) consecutive nights, where the host is compensated for providing the accommodation."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key elements of this definition:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Under 30 nights</strong> - rentals of 30+ consecutive nights aren't STRs</li>
            <li><strong>Compensation required</strong> - free guest stays aren't regulated</li>
            <li><strong>All or part</strong> - includes whole-home and room rentals</li>
            <li><strong>Dwelling unit</strong> - must be in a residential property</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Hotels, motels, and B&Bs:</strong> Traditional hospitality businesses have separate regulations. The STR by-law specifically targets residential properties being rented through platforms like Airbnb.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Requirement</h2>
          <p>This is the cornerstone of Ottawa's STR rules:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No person shall operate a short-term rental unless the dwelling unit is the principal residence of the host."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 4(1)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The by-law defines principal residence as where you "ordinarily reside" - your main home, not a vacation property or investment unit. You can only have one principal residence.</p>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Properties Don't Qualify</h4>
            <p>You cannot operate an STR from an investment condo, a second home in the city, or any property that isn't your primary residence. For investment properties, consider mid-term rentals (30+ consecutive nights) which fall outside the STR definition.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="cottage-exception">The Cottage Rental Exception</h2>
          <p>Ottawa has a unique provision for rural cottage owners:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A cottage rental is the temporary use of a dwelling unit that is not the principal residence of the host, for less than thirty (30) consecutive nights... in a rural zone."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>If your cottage is located in one of Ottawa's designated rural zones, you can rent it short-term even if it's not your principal residence. This recognizes the traditional cottage rental economy in Ottawa's vast rural areas.</p>

          <h2 id="permit-requirements">Permit Requirements</h2>
          <p>Every Ottawa STR host needs a valid permit:</p>

          <h3>Application Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Completed application form</strong> with property details</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of principal residence</strong> (or rural cottage ownership)</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing the rental space</li>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Your permit number must be displayed on all listings and advertisements for your property.</p>

          <h2 id="platform-rules">Platform Registration Requirements</h2>
          <p>Ottawa requires STR platforms to register and cooperate with enforcement:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No person shall operate a short-term rental platform unless registered with the City and compliant with the requirements of this by-law."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 8</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Platforms like Airbnb must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Register with the City</strong> and pay applicable fees</li>
            <li><strong>Only list permitted hosts</strong> - verify permit numbers</li>
            <li><strong>Collect and remit MAT</strong> (4% Municipal Accommodation Tax)</li>
            <li><strong>Share data with the City</strong> for enforcement purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Remove unlicensed listings</strong> upon City request</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="occupancy-limits">Guest Limits</h2>
          <p>Ottawa sets clear limits on how many people can stay:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The maximum number of overnight guests in a short-term rental shall not exceed eight (8) persons in a dwelling unit, or ten (10) persons in an oversize dwelling unit."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 6</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <div class="comparison-header">
              <div class="comparison-col">Dwelling Type</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Max Overnight Guests</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Standard dwelling unit</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>8 persons</strong></div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Oversize dwelling unit</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight"><strong>10 persons</strong></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>These are overnight limits. You can have additional guests during the day for events, but overnight stays are capped at these numbers.</p>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Ottawa requires hosts to maintain adequate coverage:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A host shall maintain liability insurance of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) that covers the short-term rental operation."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 5</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key insurance requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$1,000,000 minimum</strong> liability coverage per occurrence</li>
            <li><strong>Must specifically cover</strong> short-term rental activities</li>
            <li><strong>Proof required</strong> with permit application and renewals</li>
            <li><strong>Keep policy current</strong> - gaps in coverage violate the by-law</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Standard homeowner's insurance won't work:</strong> Most policies exclude short-term rental activities. Contact your insurer about a rider or get specialized STR insurance. Airbnb's Host Protection Insurance supplements but doesn't replace your own coverage.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mat-tax">Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</h2>
          <p>Ottawa charges 4% MAT on all short-term rentals:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Every purchaser of transient accommodation shall pay to the provider thereof a tax at the rate of four per cent (4%) of the purchase price."
            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2017-255</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>For most hosts, this is handled automatically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform bookings:</strong> Airbnb and other registered platforms collect and remit MAT directly</li>
            <li><strong>Direct bookings:</strong> You must collect 4% from guests and remit to the City</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Platforms report to the City quarterly</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Ottawa's penalties are among the steepest in Ontario:</p>

          <div class="comparison-table">

            <cite>Ottawa By-law 2021-104 § 14</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="compliance-tips">Staying Compliant in Ottawa</h2>
          <p>As Canada's capital, Ottawa takes bylaw enforcement seriously. Here's how to stay on the right side:</p>

          <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><span class="tip-icon">1</span> <strong>Get your permit first.</strong> Don't list your property until you have a valid permit number. Operating without one is the easiest violation to catch.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">2</span> <strong>Display your permit number.</strong> It must appear on every listing, advertisement, and booking confirmation. This is how the City verifies compliance.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">3</span> <strong>Verify your insurance annually.</strong> Make sure your policy specifically mentions short-term rental coverage. Get written confirmation from your insurer.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">4</span> <strong>Track guest counts.</strong> The 8/10 person overnight limit is strict. Large groups booking for parties are a red flag.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">5</span> <strong>Respond to complaints promptly.</strong> Noise and nuisance complaints that go unaddressed can lead to permit revocation.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">6</span> <strong>Keep good records.</strong> Document all bookings, guest communications, and any incidents. You may need to produce these for inspectors.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">7</span> <strong>Renew before expiry.</strong> Your 2-year permit has a hard expiration date. Operating on an expired permit is operating without one.</li>
            <li><span class="tip-icon">8</span> <strong>Consider mid-term for flexibility.</strong> Rentals of 30+ consecutive nights aren't subject to these STR rules. Good for off-peak seasons or corporate stays.</li>
          </ul>
