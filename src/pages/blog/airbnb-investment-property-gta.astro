            <p class="lead">If you own an investment property in the Greater Toronto Area and are considering listing it on Airbnb, you've probably heard about the <strong>principal residence requirement</strong>. Here's what the rules actually say, what hosts are doing in practice, and your options.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Rule</h2>
          <p>Most municipalities in the GTA have short-term rental regulations that include a <strong>principal residence requirement</strong>. On paper, this means:</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"></line>
                <line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"></line>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>The Official Rule:</strong> In Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Hamilton, and Oakville, short-term rentals (under 28-30 days) are supposed to be operated from your primary home.
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>That's what the bylaws say. But like many regulations, the reality on the ground is more nuanced.</p>

          <h2 id="what-hosts-doing">What Hosts Are Actually Doing</h2>
          <p>We can't provide legal advice, and we're not suggesting anyone break rules. But here's what we're seeing across the GTA:</p>

          <div class="info-grid" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Some hosts claim principal residence</h4>
              <p>Some investment property owners register their property as their principal residence for STR purposes. They may spend time there, keep belongings there, or have mail delivered there. <strong>We can't advise on this approach</strong> — there are potential risks if the city investigates and determines the property isn't genuinely your primary home. This is a personal decision that some hosts make, but it's not something we can recommend or guide you on.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Enforcement varies widely</h4>
              <p>Different cities have different enforcement approaches. Some are complaint-driven, others are more proactive. Some hosts have operated for years without issues. Others have received notices. The landscape can change, and what works today may not work tomorrow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Mid-term is the clean path</h4>
              <p>Many investors choose mid-term rentals (28+ days) because it's completely exempt from STR rules. No gray areas, no registration required, and strong demand from corporate travelers and relocations. This is the approach we can fully support.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p><strong>We can't provide legal advice on residency claims.</strong> If you're considering registering an investment property as your principal residence, consult with a lawyer who understands municipal bylaws. What we can do is help you execute a mid-term rental strategy or manage your property once you've made your own decisions about registration.</p>

          <h2 id="gta-cities">GTA Cities & Their Rules</h2>
          <p>Here's a quick overview of how major GTA cities handle investment properties and short-term rentals:</p>

          <div class="table-container">
            <table class="rules-table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>City</th>
                  <th>Principal Residence</th>
                  <th>Limits</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                {cityRules.map(city => (
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>{city.city}</strong></td>
                    <td>{city.rule}</td>
                    <td>{city.limit}</td>
                  </tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p class="table-note">Note: Regulations change frequently. Always verify current rules with your municipality before listing.</p>

          <p class="table-note"><strong>*Why "No written limit"?</strong> Vaughan, Hamilton, and Oakville don't specify a maximum number of nights in their bylaws like Toronto does. However, they all require principal residence — meaning you must ordinarily live there, keep your identification and documents at that address, and conduct your daily affairs from that home. While there's no explicit cap, <strong>we don't recommend exceeding 180 nights of short-term rentals per year</strong>. If you're away more than half the year, it becomes harder to demonstrate the property is genuinely your principal residence. The CRA and municipalities generally expect you to spend the majority of your time (183+ days) at your principal residence.</p>

          <h2 id="what-qualifies">What Qualifies as Principal Residence?</h2>
          <p>To meet the principal residence requirement, your property typically must be:</p>

          <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Where You Live</h4>
              <p>The address on your driver's license, tax returns, and voter registration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Your Primary Home</h4>
              <p>Where you spend most of your time and receive mail.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
              <h4>Documented</h4>
              <p>You'll need proof of residency when registering with the city.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Common documentation includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ontario driver's license with the property address</li>
            <li>Tax returns showing the address</li>
            <li>Utility bills in your name</li>
            <li>Bank statements</li>
            <li>Voter registration</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="alternatives">Your Options for Investment Properties</h2>
          <p>Here are the paths investment property owners in the GTA are taking:</p>

          <div class="alternatives-grid">
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">1</span>
              <h4>Short-Term with Registration</h4>
              <p>Some owners register the property and operate STRs. This can be the highest-earning option, but carries risk if residency is questioned. We can't advise on this path — consult a lawyer if considering it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">2</span>
              <h4>Mid-Term Rentals (30+ days)</h4>
              <p>Exempt from STR regulations entirely. Strong demand from corporate travelers and relocations. The "clean" path with no gray areas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">3</span>
              <h4>Corporate Housing</h4>
              <p>Furnished rentals for business travelers, often 1-6 months. Higher rates than unfurnished long-term, and listed on platforms like Furnished Finder.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alternative-card">
              <span class="alt-number">4</span>
              <h4>Traditional Long-Term Rental</h4>
              <p>Standard 12-month leases provide stable, predictable income with less management overhead. Lower returns but lowest effort.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="mid-term">Mid-Term Rental Strategy</h2>
          <p>Mid-term rentals (30+ days) offer a compelling middle ground for investment property owners:</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"></path>
                <polyline points="22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01"></polyline>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Benefits of Mid-Term Rentals:</strong>
              <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <li>Exempt from most STR regulations</li>
                <li>Higher rates than traditional long-term leases</li>
                <li>Less turnover than short-term rentals</li>
                <li>Still listed on Airbnb, VRBO, and Furnished Finder</li>
                <li>Attracts quality tenants (business travelers, relocations)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Many property owners find mid-term rentals provide 20-50% higher returns than traditional long-term leases while avoiding the regulatory complexities of short-term rentals.</p>

          <h3>Who Rents Mid-Term?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Corporate employees on temporary assignments</li>
            <li>Healthcare professionals on contracts</li>
            <li>Families relocating to the GTA</li>
            <li>Students doing internships or co-op terms</li>
            <li>People between homes during renovations or sales</li>
            <li>Snowbirds needing a base for part of the year</li>
