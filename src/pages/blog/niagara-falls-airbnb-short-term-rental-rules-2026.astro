const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Niagara Falls?", a: "Yes, and this is what makes Niagara Falls unusual. Their Vacation Rental Unit (VRU) license doesn't require principal residence. You need a licensed responsible person available 24/7 within one hour of the property, but you don't have to live there. This is one of the few Ontario cities where investment property STRs are genuinely viable." },
  { q: "What's the difference between VRU and OOSTR licenses?", a: "VRU (Vacation Rental Unit) is for entire-home rentals where you're not on-site. No principal residence needed, but you need a responsible person within one hour. OOSTR (Owner Occupied Short-Term Accommodation) is like a B&B where you live on-site while hosting guests. OOSTR has a 150m spacing rule from other OOSTRs." },
  { q: "What happens if I get complaints about my rental?", a: "Niagara Falls uses a three-strike system. Three sustained complaints or violations within one calendar year means automatic 6-month license suspension. After that, you can reapply but your track record follows you. The city takes noise and nuisance complaints seriously given the tourist area dynamics." },
  { q: "Do I need to be available 24/7 for my rental?", a: "For VRU licenses, your designated responsible person must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and able to arrive at the property within one hour of being contacted. This can be you, a property manager, or another licensed responsible person." },
  { q: "What inspections are required?", a: "You'll need three inspections: Fire Department (fire safety plan, smoke/CO detectors, extinguishers), Niagara Region Health (sanitation, water), and ESA electrical certificate. All must pass before your license is approved. Budget time for scheduling and potential re-inspections." },
  { q: "Can I rent to large groups for bachelor/bachelorette parties?", a: "Technically yes, but you're liable for their behavior. The bylaw holds operators responsible for guest conduct. If a party gets three noise complaints in a year, that's your license suspended for 6 months. Many hosts set strict house rules and guest limits to avoid this." },
  { q: "What's the maximum stay allowed?", a: "28 consecutive days or less qualifies as short-term rental under the bylaw. Anything longer is considered a regular tenancy and falls under different rules (Residential Tenancies Act). Most hosts target the tourist market with 2-7 night stays." },
  { q: "Is there a MAT (Municipal Accommodation Tax)?", a: "Niagara Falls charges a flat $2 per night per room MAT, which is different from the percentage-based MAT in cities like Toronto. Airbnb collects and remits this automatically, so you don't have to handle it manually." },
  { q: "Can I operate multiple STRs in Niagara Falls?", a: "Yes, there's no limit on how many VRU licenses you can hold. Each property needs its own license, inspections, and responsible person coverage. Some investors run multiple units, treating it like a hospitality business rather than a side hustle." }

            <p class="lead">Here's something most Ontario investors don't realize: <strong>Niagara Falls is one of the few cities where you can legally Airbnb an investment property</strong>. No principal residence requirement for their Vacation Rental Unit license. With 12+ million tourists visiting annually, that's a significant opportunity.</p>
            <p class="lead">But the rules are different from Toronto or Mississauga. There are two license types, a three-strike complaint system, and some unique requirements. Let me walk you through how it actually works.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-types">Two Different License Types</h2>
          <p>Niagara Falls has two distinct STR licenses under By-law 2021-57 (amended by 2025-033). Which one you need depends on whether you'll be living at the property:</p>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Owner must reside on property</div>

              <div class="comparison-col highlight">150m spacing from other OOSTRs</div>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-row">
              <div class="comparison-col">Best for: Investors, vacation homes</div>
              <div class="comparison-col highlight">Best for: Live-in hosts</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="vru-explained">VRU License: The Investment Property Option</h2>
          <p>This is what makes Niagara Falls attractive for investors. The Vacation Rental Unit license lets you rent out an entire dwelling unit without living there yourself.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Vacation Rental Unit means a dwelling unit that is used to provide sleeping accommodations for any rental period of twenty-eight (28) consecutive days or less in exchange for payment."
            <cite>Niagara Falls By-law 2021-57, Section 1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Key difference from most Ontario cities:</strong> Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, and Oakville all require STRs to be your principal residence. Niagara Falls doesn't. You can own a condo near the Falls, live in Toronto, and legally rent it short-term with a VRU license.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>VRU Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Responsible person</strong> available 24/7 who can arrive within 1 hour</li>
            <li><strong>$2 million</strong> commercial general liability insurance</li>
            <li><strong>Fire, health, and electrical inspections</strong> must pass</li>
            <li><strong>License renewal</strong> required annually (expires April 30th)</li>
            <li><strong>License number</strong> displayed on all advertisements</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="oostr-explained">OOSTR License: Owner-Occupied Option</h2>
          <p>If you're going to live at the property while hosting guests, the Owner Occupied Short-Term Rental Accommodation license works more like a traditional B&B arrangement.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Owner Occupied Short-Term Rental Accommodation means a dwelling unit in which the owner of the dwelling unit resides and uses a portion of the dwelling unit to provide sleeping accommodations for twenty-eight (28) consecutive days or less."
            <cite>Niagara Falls By-law 2021-57, Section 1 Definitions</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>The 150-Metre Spacing Rule</h3>
          <p>Here's the catch with OOSTR licenses: there's a minimum distance requirement.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No OOSTR Licence shall be issued for a property that is within 150 metres of another property that holds a valid OOSTR Licence."
            <cite>Niagara Falls By-law 2021-57, Section 6.3</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This means you can't have multiple owner-occupied STRs clustering on the same street. The city measures this property-line to property-line. If your neighbor already has an OOSTR license, you might be out of luck for that license type (though VRU has no spacing restriction).</p>

          <h2 id="requirements">License Requirements Checklist</h2>
          <p>Whether you're applying for VRU or OOSTR, here's what you'll need:</p>

          <div class="requirements-grid">
            <div class="requirement-card">
              <h4>Documentation</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Completed application form</li>
                <li>Property ownership proof</li>
                <li>Floor plan showing sleeping areas</li>
                <li>Parking plan (2 spaces minimum)</li>
                <li>$2M liability insurance certificate</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-card">
              <h4>Inspections Required</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Fire Department inspection</li>
                <li>Niagara Region Health inspection</li>
                <li>ESA electrical certificate</li>
                <li>Building compliance verification</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="requirement-card">
              <h4>Fees</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Initial license application fee</li>
                <li>Annual renewal fee</li>
                <li>Inspection fees (separate)</li>
                <li>$2/night MAT tax (collected by platforms)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="responsible-person">The Responsible Person Rule</h2>
          <p>For VRU licenses, you must designate a "responsible person" who can handle emergencies and complaints. This is non-negotiable.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "The Responsible Person shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week and be able to attend the property within one (1) hour of being contacted."
            <cite>Niagara Falls By-law 2021-57, Section 5.7</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="success-box">
            <h4>Who Can Be Your Responsible Person:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>You</strong> (if you live within 1 hour of the property)</li>
              <li><strong>A licensed property manager</strong> (like us at Nurture)</li>
              <li><strong>A local contact</strong> you designate who meets the criteria</li>
              <li><strong>A co-host</strong> who lives nearby and is listed on your license</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>The responsible person's contact information must be provided to guests and to neighbors within a specified radius. If there's a noise complaint at 2am, someone needs to be able to respond.</p>

          <h2 id="inspections">Required Inspections Explained</h2>
          <p>Three separate inspections must pass before your license is approved:</p>

          <h3>1. Fire Department Inspection</h3>
          <p>The Niagara Falls Fire Department will check:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Smoke detectors on every level and in sleeping areas</li>
            <li>Carbon monoxide detectors near sleeping areas</li>
            <li>Fire extinguisher (minimum 2A:10BC rating)</li>
            <li>Clear exit paths and emergency egress</li>
            <li>Fire safety plan posted for guests</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Health Department Inspection</h3>
          <p>Niagara Region Public Health verifies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Potable water supply</li>
            <li>Proper sewage/septic system</li>
            <li>Sanitary conditions throughout</li>
            <li>Food preparation areas (if applicable)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Electrical Safety Authority (ESA)</h3>
          <p>You'll need an ESA certificate confirming:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Electrical system meets Ontario Electrical Safety Code</li>
            <li>No hazardous conditions</li>
            <li>Proper grounding and panel capacity</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Inspection Tips</h4>
            <p>Schedule inspections early in your application process. Each department has its own timeline, and re-inspections (if you fail) add weeks. Budget 4-8 weeks for all inspections to clear.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="three-strike">The Three-Strike Complaint System</h2>
          <p>This is where Niagara Falls gets serious. They track complaints and violations, and three strikes means automatic suspension.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Where an Operator accumulates three (3) or more demerit points within a calendar year, the Licence shall be automatically suspended for a period of six (6) months."
            <cite>Niagara Falls By-law 2021-57, Section 8.2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>What Counts as a Strike</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sustained noise complaints</strong> verified by bylaw officers</li>
            <li><strong>Parking violations</strong> related to your rental</li>
            <li><strong>Occupancy violations</strong> (too many guests)</li>
            <li><strong>Operating without valid license</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Failing to provide guest registry</strong> when requested</li>
            <li><strong>Responsible person not responding</strong> within required time</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">

            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>The bachelor party problem:</strong> Niagara Falls sees a lot of bachelor/bachelorette groups. Three noise complaints from one wild weekend could cost you your license for six months. Many successful hosts use strict guest screening and house rules to avoid this.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>After a Suspension</h3>
          <p>Once suspended, you cannot operate for 6 months. After that period, you can reapply, but the city considers your history. Repeated suspensions can lead to permanent license denial.</p>

          <h2 id="penalties">Fines and Penalties</h2>
          <p>Operating without a license or violating the bylaw comes with significant fines:</p>

          <div class="penalty-table">

              <span class="penalty-type">First offense</span>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">

          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="why-niagara">Why Niagara Falls Works for Investors</h2>
          <p>With all these rules, is it still worth it? For the right property, absolutely. Here's why:</p>

          <h3>The Tourism Numbers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>12+ million visitors</strong> annually to Niagara Falls</li>
            <li><strong>Peak season (May-October)</strong> commands premium rates</li>
            <li><strong>Year-round events</strong>: Winter Festival of Lights, concerts at Fallsview Casino</li>
            <li><strong>International draw</strong>: tourists from around the world, not just Ontario</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>No Night Limit</h3>
          <p>Unlike Toronto's 180-night cap, Niagara Falls has no annual limit on rental nights. If you have consistent bookings, you can operate 365 days a year.</p>

          <h3>Investment Property Friendly</h3>
          <p>This is the big one. You can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Own a property in Niagara Falls while living in Toronto</li>
            <li>Use a property manager as your responsible person</li>
            <li>Build a portfolio of multiple VRU-licensed properties</li>
            <li>Treat it as a real hospitality business, not just a side income</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Revenue Comparison: Niagara Falls vs. Long-Term Rental</h4>
