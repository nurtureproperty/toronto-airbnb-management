const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Brampton?", a: "No. Brampton requires your STR to be your principal residence, meaning you must ordinarily live there. Investment properties, vacation homes, and second properties do not qualify. However, mid-term rentals of 28+ days are exempt from these restrictions." },
  { q: "Is there a night limit for Airbnb in Brampton?", a: "Yes. Brampton limits short-term rentals to a maximum of 180 nights per calendar year, the same as Toronto and Mississauga. This applies to entire-unit rentals at your principal residence." },
  { q: "How much is the Brampton STR license?", a: "The license fee is $150.00 annually, due by September 30th each year. Late renewals incur a $50 fee. The license is non-refundable once issued." },
  { q: "How many bedrooms can I rent in Brampton?", a: "If you're renting rooms individually (partial-unit rental while you remain home), no more than 3 bedrooms can be rented at any one time. This limit does not apply to entire-unit rentals where guests have the whole property." },
  { q: "Do I need a background check for a Brampton STR license?", a: "Yes. You must provide a criminal record check confirming no criminal convictions within the last 3 years. This applies to individuals or all officers/directors if applying as a corporation." },
  { q: "Can tenants operate an STR in Brampton?", a: "Yes, if you're a tenant in a two-unit dwelling and it's your principal residence. You need written permission from your landlord and must meet all other application requirements." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need for Airbnb in Brampton?", a: "You need Commercial General Liability insurance of at least $2,000,000 per occurrence. The insurance must be maintained throughout the license period." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Brampton and Toronto rules?", a: "Both cities use 28 days as the STR threshold and have a 180-night annual limit. Both require principal residence and licensing. Brampton's license fee ($150) is generally lower than Toronto's registration process." }

            <p class="lead">Brampton regulates short-term rentals under <strong>By-Law 165-2021</strong>, which came into effect on July 8, 2021. If you're thinking about listing your property on Airbnb or VRBO in Brampton, understanding these rules is essential for staying compliant and operating legally.</p>
            <p class="lead">This guide covers everything you need to know about Brampton's STR regulations, from the principal residence requirement to licensing, insurance, and the 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>Under Brampton's bylaw, a short-term rental is defined as:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Rental (STR) means all or part of a Principal Residence used to provide sleeping accommodations for any rental period that is less than twenty-eight (28) consecutive days in exchange for payment, but does not include bed and breakfast, hotels, motels, or hospital, or other short-term rentals where there is no payment."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Part II, Section 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This means any rental of less than 28 days requires licensing and must follow all STR regulations. Rentals of 28 consecutive days or more are not considered short-term rentals and are exempt from these rules.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Same as Toronto:</strong> Brampton uses the same 28-day threshold as Toronto. This is different from Vaughan (29 days) and Mississauga (30 days).
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="night-limit">180-Night Annual Limit</h2>
          <p>Brampton imposes a strict annual limit on short-term rentals:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Short-Term Rental Host shall rent a property for a total of more than one hundred eighty (180) nights per calendar year."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 23</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>180 Nights Per Year Maximum</h4>
            <p>Like Toronto and Mississauga, Brampton caps entire-home short-term rentals at 180 nights per calendar year. The count resets on January 1st each year.</p>
          </div>

          <p>This 180-night limit means you can STR your principal residence for roughly half the year. For hosts wanting year-round rental income, consider combining STR with mid-term rentals (28+ days) which don't count toward this limit.</p>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Rule</h2>
          <p>This is the most important rule for prospective hosts to understand. Brampton only allows STRs at your principal residence:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal Residence means a dwelling unit owned or rented by a Person, either alone or jointly with others, where the Person is ordinarily resident."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Part II, Section 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Key requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The property must be your <strong>principal residence</strong></li>
            <li>You can only have <strong>one principal residence</strong> at any time</li>
            <li>You must <strong>ordinarily reside</strong> at the property</li>
            <li>The property must comply with <strong>zoning, building code, and fire code</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>What This Means for Property Investors</h4>
            <p>If you own an investment property, vacation home, or second property in Brampton, you <strong>cannot</strong> operate it as a short-term rental. The bylaw explicitly states:</p>
            <p><em>"You are no longer permitted to operate an investment property for the purpose of a short-term rental accommodation as it will be in violation of the business licensing by-law."</em></p>
            <p>Looking to rent an investment property? Consider <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">mid-term rentals</a> (28+ days) which are exempt from these restrictions.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Maximum Bedrooms for Room Rentals</h3>
          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No more than three (3) Bedrooms are to be individually rented in the Principal Residence at any one time."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 16</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This rule applies to <strong>partial-unit rentals</strong> where you rent individual rooms while remaining in the home. If you have a 5-bedroom house and want to rent rooms separately, you can only rent 3 at any given time. This limit does not apply to entire-unit rentals where guests book the whole property.</p>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: The Alternative Strategy</h2>
          <p>Since Brampton's STR rules only apply to rentals under 28 days, <strong>mid-term rentals are completely exempt</strong> from these regulations.</p>

          <h3>What Qualifies as Mid-Term?</h3>
          <p>Any rental of 28 consecutive days or more in Brampton:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does <strong>not</strong> require an STR license</li>
            <li>Does <strong>not</strong> require principal residence status</li>
            <li>Can be operated on investment properties</li>
            <li>Is not subject to the 180-night limit</li>
            <li>Is not subject to the MAT</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Why Mid-Term Works Well in Brampton</h4>
            <p>Brampton has strong mid-term rental demand due to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pearson Airport proximity:</strong> Airline crews and airport workers need housing</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon &amp; logistics hubs:</strong> Distribution centers bring temporary workers</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare workers:</strong> Brampton Civic Hospital and healthcare facilities</li>
              <li><strong>New immigrants:</strong> Large newcomer population seeking temporary housing</li>
              <li><strong>Construction projects:</strong> Ongoing development throughout Peel Region</li>
              <li><strong>Students:</strong> Sheridan College Brampton campus</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>Before operating any STR in Brampton, you must obtain a license from the city.</p>

          <h3>License Fees</h3>
          <div class="fee-table">
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Fee Type</th>
                  <th>Amount</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Application or Renewal Fee</td>
                  <td>$150.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Late Renewal Fee</td>
                  <td>$50.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Closed File Administration</td>
                  <td>$50.00</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <h2 id="background-check">Background Check Requirements</h2>
          <p>Brampton requires a criminal record check for all STR license applicants:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A criminal record search conducted by the Police in whose jurisdiction the Applicant resides, or where the Applicant is a corporation or partnership then a criminal record search of all officers, directors or partners, confirming that there are no outstanding criminal charges or warrants pending before any courts, or any criminal record convictions within the last three (3) years."

            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 52</cite>
          </blockquote>
