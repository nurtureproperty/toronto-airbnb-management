const faqs = [
  { q: "Can I Airbnb my investment property in Brampton?", a: "Nope. Same story as Toronto and Mississauga. Brampton only allows STRs at your principal residence. That investment property in Heart Lake or Springdale? Can't STR it. But mid-term rentals (28+ days) are exempt from this rule, so there's still a path to rental income." },
  { q: "Is there a night limit for Airbnb in Brampton?", a: "Yes, 180 nights per calendar year for entire-unit rentals. It's the same cap as Toronto and Mississauga. After you hit 180 nights, you're done until January 1st unless you pivot to mid-term rentals or switch to renting rooms while you're home." },
  { q: "How much is the Brampton STR license?", a: "$150 per year, due by September 30th. Miss the deadline and you'll pay an extra $50 late fee. It's actually one of the more affordable licenses in the GTA. Cheaper than most other cities' registration processes." },
  { q: "How many bedrooms can I rent in Brampton?", a: "For room rentals where you stay home, max 3 bedrooms at any one time. Got a 5-bedroom house and want to rent individual rooms? Pick your best 3. This doesn't apply if you're renting the whole place to one guest or group." },
  { q: "Do I need a background check for a Brampton STR license?", a: "Yes, but it's less intensive than some cities. You need a criminal record check showing no convictions in the last 3 years. If you're applying through a corporation, every officer and director needs one." },
  { q: "Can tenants operate an STR in Brampton?", a: "Actually yes, which is different from some cities. If you're a tenant in a two-unit dwelling and it's your principal residence, you can STR. You'll need written permission from your landlord though. Don't skip that step." },
  { q: "What insurance do I need for Airbnb in Brampton?", a: "Commercial General Liability insurance with at least $2M coverage per occurrence. Your regular homeowner's insurance probably doesn't cover STR activity, so you'll need to get specific coverage. Airbnb's host protection helps but the city wants to see your own policy." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Brampton and Toronto rules?", a: "Honestly? Pretty similar. Both use 28 days as the STR threshold. Both have a 180-night annual limit. Both require principal residence and licensing. Brampton's license is cheaper ($150 vs Toronto's higher fees) but the overall framework is basically the same." }

        <article class="article-content">
          <div class="article-intro">
            <p class="lead">Brampton's STR rules are pretty similar to Toronto's. Same 180-night annual limit, same principal residence requirement, same basic framework. But here's the thing: Brampton's licensing process is actually simpler and cheaper than most GTA cities. $150 a year, straightforward application, and you're good to go.</p>
            <p class="lead">The rules come from <strong>By-Law 165-2021</strong>, in effect since July 2021. Let me walk you through what actually matters: who can host, night limits, the 3-bedroom rule for room rentals, insurance requirements, and the 4% MAT.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="what-is-str">What Counts as a Short-Term Rental?</h2>
          <p>In Brampton, anything under 28 consecutive days is a short-term rental. The official definition from the bylaw:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Short-Term Rental (STR) means all or part of a Principal Residence used to provide sleeping accommodations for any rental period that is less than twenty-eight (28) consecutive days in exchange for payment, but does not include bed and breakfast, hotels, motels, or hospital, or other short-term rentals where there is no payment."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Part II, Section 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>So a weekend rental to families visiting Wet'n'Wild Toronto? Short-term. A 3-week stay for someone relocating to Peel Region? Still short-term. But hit 28 days exactly? That's mid-term and different rules entirely.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-icon">
              <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle>
                <path d="M12 16v-4"></path>
                <path d="M12 8h.01"></path>
              </svg>
            </div>
            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Same Threshold as Toronto:</strong> Both Brampton and Toronto use 28 days. Vaughan uses 29 days, Mississauga uses 30. Keep this straight if you're comparing options across cities.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 id="night-limit">180-Night Annual Limit</h2>
          <p>Like Toronto and Mississauga, Brampton caps you at 180 nights per year for entire-unit rentals:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No Short-Term Rental Host shall rent a property for a total of more than one hundred eighty (180) nights per calendar year."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 23</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>180 Nights Per Year Maximum</h4>
            <p>Count resets January 1st. If you're running a busy listing, you'll hit this sometime in July or August. Plan accordingly.</p>
          </div>

          <p>The math works out to roughly half the year. For hosts who want income year-round, the play is combining short-term with mid-term rentals. Use your 180 nights during peak demand (summer, holidays), then switch to 28+ day stays for the rest of the year. Those don't count against your limit.</p>

          <h2 id="principal-residence">The Principal Residence Rule</h2>
          <p>Same deal as the rest of the GTA. You can only STR where you actually live. The bylaw defines it this way:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Principal Residence means a dwelling unit owned or rented by a Person, either alone or jointly with others, where the Person is ordinarily resident."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Part II, Section 2</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>What this boils down to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It has to be your <strong>actual home</strong>, where you sleep, get mail, pay bills</li>
            <li>You can only have <strong>one principal residence</strong> at a time (obviously)</li>
            <li>The property needs to meet <strong>zoning, building code, and fire code</strong> requirements</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Investment Property Owners</h4>
            <p>The city is explicit about this one. Their exact words: <em>"You are no longer permitted to operate an investment property for the purpose of a short-term rental accommodation as it will be in violation of the business licensing by-law."</em></p>
            <p>Got a rental property in Castlemore or a condo in downtown Brampton? Can't STR it. But <a href="/services/mid-term-rental-management">mid-term rentals</a> (28+ days) are exempt - that's the path for investment properties.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>The 3-Bedroom Rule for Room Rentals</h3>
          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "No more than three (3) Bedrooms are to be individually rented in the Principal Residence at any one time."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 16</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This trips some people up, so let me be clear: <strong>this only applies when you're renting rooms individually while you stay home</strong>. Got a 5-bedroom house in Sandalwood and want to rent 3 rooms on Airbnb while you live there? That's fine. Want to rent 4? Nope.</p>

          <p>If you're doing entire-unit rentals where you leave and guests have the whole place? This bedroom limit doesn't apply - they can use all the bedrooms.</p>

          <h2 id="mid-term-strategy">Mid-Term Rentals: The Alternative Strategy</h2>
          <p>Here's the workaround that makes investment properties viable. Since Brampton's STR rules only apply to rentals under 28 days, <strong>mid-term rentals are completely exempt</strong>.</p>

          <h3>What Changes at 28 Days?</h3>
          <p>When your rental hits 28 consecutive days or more:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No STR license needed</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No principal residence requirement</strong> (investment properties work)</li>
            <li><strong>No 180-night cap</strong> (rent year-round)</li>
            <li><strong>No MAT</strong> (you keep that extra 4%)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="strategy-box">
            <h4>Why Mid-Term Works Well in Brampton</h4>
            <p>Brampton has seriously strong mid-term demand. We've placed tenants from all these sources:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pearson Airport:</strong> Flight crews, ground staff, airline contractors. The airport is 15 minutes away and always needs housing.</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon and logistics:</strong> The distribution centers in Brampton and nearby Mississauga bring in workers on 3-6 month contracts.</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare workers:</strong> Brampton Civic Hospital is one of the busiest in Ontario. Travel nurses, specialists, administrative staff all need temporary housing.</li>
              <li><strong>New immigrants:</strong> Brampton has one of the largest newcomer populations in Canada. Families need landing spots while they find permanent housing.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction crews:</strong> With all the development in Peel Region, contractors need places to stay.</li>
              <li><strong>Students:</strong> Sheridan College's Brampton campus brings students who don't want traditional dorms.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="license-requirements">License Requirements</h2>
          <p>Good news: Brampton's licensing process is one of the more straightforward ones in the GTA. $150, some paperwork, and you're set.</p>

          <h3>License Fees</h3>
          <div class="fee-table">
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Fee Type</th>
                  <th>Amount</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Application or Renewal Fee</td>
                  <td>$150.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Late Renewal Fee</td>
                  <td>$50.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Closed File Administration</td>
                  <td>$50.00</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>Heads up: these fees adjust each January based on Toronto's Consumer Price Index. They creep up a bit every year.</p>

          <h3>What You Need to Apply</h3>
          <p>The application checklist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Completed application form</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Declaration</strong> confirming it's your principal residence</li>
            <li><strong>Floor plan</strong> showing which areas you'll rent and square footage</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong>, or landlord permission if you're a tenant</li>
            <li><strong>$150 license fee</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Proof of $2M liability insurance</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Criminal record check</strong> showing no convictions in the past 3 years</li>
            <li><strong>Guest information package</strong> with emergency contacts, fire safety info, parking rules, waste disposal</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout">

            <div class="callout-content">
              <strong>Tenants:</strong> You can STR as a tenant in Brampton (two-unit dwellings), but you need written landlord permission. Get it in writing before you apply - the city will ask.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Don't Let Your License Lapse</h3>
          <p>Mark your calendar. Licenses expire <strong>September 30th</strong> every year:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Renew before September 30th = no problems</li>
            <li>Late by up to 60 days = $50 late fee</li>
            <li>Late by 90+ days = license cancelled, you start over from scratch</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Where to Submit</h3>
          <p>Send everything to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> licensing@brampton.ca</li>
            <li><strong>In Person:</strong> City Hall, First Floor, City Clerk's Office (Licensing Administration)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="background-check">Background Check Requirements</h2>
          <p>You'll need a criminal record check, but Brampton's requirements are actually less stringent than some other cities like Vaughan. Here's what the bylaw says:</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "A criminal record search conducted by the Police in whose jurisdiction the Applicant resides, or where the Applicant is a corporation or partnership then a criminal record search of all officers, directors or partners, confirming that there are no outstanding criminal charges or warrants pending before any courts, or any criminal record convictions within the last three (3) years."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 14(6)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>What they're looking for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No outstanding criminal charges or warrants</li>
            <li>No criminal convictions in the past 3 years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Get this from Peel Regional Police. Unlike Vaughan's Vulnerable Sector Check, a standard criminal record check works here. It's faster and easier to obtain.</p>

          <h2 id="insurance">Insurance Requirements</h2>
          <p>This is non-negotiable. You need $2 million in liability coverage. Most people's regular homeowner's insurance doesn't cover STR activity, so you'll likely need a separate policy.</p>

          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Every Person shall, before the issuance of a Licence to him or her, provide proof of Commercial General Liability insurance against all claims for personal injury including bodily injury resulting in death, and property damage with an inclusive limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 61(1)</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Insurance Checklist</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Type:</strong> Commercial General Liability</li>
              <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> $2,000,000 per occurrence</li>
              <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Personal injury, bodily injury, death, property damage</li>
              <li><strong>Keep it active:</strong> Must maintain throughout your license period</li>
              <li><strong>Heads up:</strong> If your policy gets cancelled or changed, you have 10 days to notify the city</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Airbnb offers host protection, but that's not a substitute. Brampton wants to see your own policy. Talk to your insurance broker about STR-specific coverage. Some specialize in this and the rates are reasonable.</p>

          <h2 id="compliance">Compliance Requirements</h2>
          <p>Once you've got your license, here's what you need to stay on top of to keep it.</p>

          <h3>Display Your License</h3>
          <p>Post it somewhere guests can actually see it. Don't hide it in a drawer.</p>

          <h3>Include License Number in All Listings</h3>
          <p>This one's important. Your license number needs to appear on every listing, every ad:</p>
          <blockquote class="bylaw-quote">
            "Every Short-Term Rental Host holding a Licence under this By-law shall include their Licence number in any advertisements soliciting Short-Term Rental Guests."
            <cite>Brampton By-Law 165-2021, Section 52</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Occupancy Limits</h3>
          <p>Brampton has specific rules about how many people can stay:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Max 1 person per 150 sq ft of habitable floor area</li>
            <li>Bedrooms must be at least 6 feet wide</li>
            <li>Single person bedroom: minimum 60 sq ft</li>
            <li>Multiple people: at least 40 sq ft per person</li>
            <li>Kids under 12 count as half a person for these calculations</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Guest Information Package</h3>
          <p>Every guest needs to receive a package with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your 24-hour emergency contact number</li>
            <li>Floor plan showing exits and fire safety equipment</li>
            <li>Police emergency and non-emergency contacts</li>
            <li>Nearest hospital/emergency medical services</li>
            <li>Garbage and recycling instructions</li>
            <li>Parking rules</li>
            <li>How to file complaints</li>
            <li>Fire safety plan and maximum occupancy</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This sounds like a lot, but it's basically a one-page info sheet you create once and print for every guest. Takes 20 minutes to put together.</p>

          <h3>Keep Records for 6 Years</h3>
          <p>Track everything:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Number of nights rented</li>
            <li>Nightly and total price</li>
            <li>Whether it was entire-unit or partial-unit rental</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Export your booking history from Airbnb annually and keep it filed. The city can ask for these records anytime.</p>

          <h2 id="mat">Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)</h2>
          <p>Brampton charges a 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax on all short-term rentals - same rate as most other GTA cities.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>4% MAT</h4>
            <p>This gets added to the rental price and collected from guests. Good news: Airbnb and VRBO collect and remit this automatically, so you don't have to worry about it.</p>
          </div>

          <p>If you're listing on a platform that doesn't handle MAT automatically, you'll need to collect it yourself and remit to the city. Most hosts stick to the major platforms specifically to avoid this hassle.</p>
