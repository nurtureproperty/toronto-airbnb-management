We are up front and open about what we do, and this Privacy Policy sets out how we collect your personal data, what we do with it, who we give it to, how we keep it safe and how long we store it for. Although we sell personal data, we believe that transparency is important, and we strive to do our best to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Collection of Data</h2>
        <p>We collect personal data about you when you give it to us or explicitly consent for it to be given to us. This generally occurs when you complete an online form, survey, quiz or questionnaire in which case you have chosen to consent to the collection and subsequent sale of your personal data. We collect and process the minimum amount of information we need to be able to sell your details to our client, so that our client is able to contact you about their services and deliver effectively to you the service you have expressed interest in, or to fulfil a service contract, or to meet a legal obligation. How much data we collect depends on the type of service you have expressed an interest in. This information can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your first name and last name</li>
          <li>your email address</li>
          <li>your phone number</li>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>We may also use 'cookies' on our website to provide a way for the website to recognise you and keep a track of your preferences, and to enable you to contact us directly from the website. Cookies may also be used to optimise website speed for your convenience, to allow you to customize our web pages and so that you do not have to keep filling in your details repeatedly. We may collect information about your IP address and how you used our site.</p>
        <p>That data collected by cookies does not usually identify you, but may be combined with other information to identify you. If we identify you using information from cookies, we may use that information to track how you use our website and send you information more specific to your needs, or to invite you to purchase one of our services.</p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>We sell your personal data to our clients who may use your personal data to contact you about products or services they deliver or sell. It allows us to align the products and services of our Clients as closely as possible to your needs and situation. Our clients may then contact you to offer or market their services to you. We process data by selling it and transferring it to our clients to enable our clients to deliver to you, products, services and information that you have expressed interest in, or that are compatible with the reason you provided your personal data. We may do this because you gave your consent. Once we have delivered your personal data to our client, that client becomes the controller of your personal data and they will treat your personal data in accordance with their privacy policy.

Such a transfer may include transfer of information across boarders depending on where the Client is. This means your data may be transferred to, and stored, computers outside of your state or country and the data protection laws may be different from those where you live. By agreeing to this policy, you agree to such a transfer. Data is deleted from our storage every 30 days. This means, if we have collected your personal data, we will delete it within 31 days.
