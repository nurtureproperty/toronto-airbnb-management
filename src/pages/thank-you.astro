const faqs = [
  { q: 'What makes Nurture unique?', a: 'We charge 10-15% vs the industry standard of 18-25%. We respond in under 9 minutes (not hours or days). No long contracts, you own your listing, and you get direct contact with your manager instead of group chats. We\'re locally owned in the GTA, have no hidden fees, and never mark up supplies.' },
  { q: 'How much are your management fees?', a: 'Our fees range from 10% to 15% depending on whether you want partial or full service. This is significantly lower than competitors who charge 18-25%.' },
  { q: 'Are there any startup costs?', a: 'No. We only get paid on commission. We make money when you make money. No setup fees, no monthly minimums.' },
  { q: 'How much can my property earn?', a: 'Based on our analysis of 320 Toronto listings, the average 2-bedroom earns $2,337/month. Top performers (top 10%) earn $7,054+/month. Key factors include Guest Favorite status (+104% revenue), 50+ reviews (+335%), and dynamic pricing (+27%).' },
  { q: 'How much time does running an Airbnb take?', a: 'Self-managing requires 24/7 availability for guest messages, coordinating cleaners, handling maintenance, and adjusting pricing daily. With full management, your time commitment is essentially zero. We handle everything so you can collect passive income.' },
  { q: 'Do I need insurance for short-term rentals?', a: 'Most GTA municipalities require $2 million liability insurance that explicitly covers short-term rental activity. Standard homeowner\'s insurance usually doesn\'t cover STR use. Our Professional plan includes insurance claim assistance.' },
  { q: 'How long does it take to get my property listed?', a: 'The entire process of staging, professional photos, creating your listing, and onboarding takes less than a week on average. The average client sees their first booking within 1 week of getting their listing up.' },
  { q: 'Does my property qualify for short-term rental?', a: 'Each municipality in the Greater Toronto Area has its own set of rules. Each building also has its own set of rules. To check, you can visit your local municipality website. Many cities in Ontario do require registration for short-term rental, however many do NOT have any rules around mid-term rentals.' },
  { q: 'Who handles the Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)?', a: 'We help you register with your city, and platforms like Airbnb automatically collect and remit the MAT (typically 4-8.5% depending on your municipality). Our Professional plan includes full STR registration and compliance support.' },
  { q: 'How do I restock my Airbnb?', a: 'Our Professional plan includes restocking at no extra charge with no markup. We replenish toilet paper, paper towels, soaps, shampoo, coffee, tea, and basic snacks after each guest as part of your turnover service.' },
  { q: 'Do I need a short-term rental license?', a: 'It depends on your city. Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Hamilton, and Oakville all require registration. Some cities like Ajax, Richmond Hill, and Pickering currently have no licensing requirements. Our Professional plan includes STR licensing support.' },
  { q: 'How much does it cost to furnish my Airbnb?', a: 'Costs vary significantly based on property size and style. A basic 1-bedroom setup might start around $5,000-8,000, while a fully styled 2-3 bedroom can run $15,000-25,000+. Our Professional plan includes furnishing consulting to maximize your ROI.' },
  { q: 'What if my condo doesn\'t allow short-term rentals?', a: 'Mid-term rentals (30+ days) are exempt from most STR restrictions and condo rules in the GTA. This is often the best path for investment properties or buildings with STR restrictions. We manage both short and mid-term rentals.' },
  { q: 'What happens if there is property damage?', a: 'We document the property with photos after every clean to protect you. Airbnb offers AirCover with up to $3M in damage protection. Our Professional plan includes insurance claim assistance to help you navigate any damage claims.' },
  { q: 'How do you screen guests?', a: 'We verify every guest before accepting bookings. We check for verified IDs, positive review history, and clear purpose of stay. Our screening keeps out parties and problematic guests. No parties, no problems, no headaches for you.' },
  { q: 'Can I Airbnb my property if it\'s not my primary residence?', a: 'Most GTA cities (Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Hamilton, Oakville) require STRs to be your principal residence. For investment properties, mid-term rentals (30+ days) are typically exempt from these rules and are a clear legal path.' },
  { q: 'What cities do you operate in?', a: 'We operate in any city within Southern Ontario, Canada. This includes the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding cities.' },
  { q: 'Do I have to sign a lengthy contract?', a: 'No. Our service agreement allows you to cancel with just 30-day notice. No long-term contracts.' },
  { q: 'Who owns the listing on Airbnb?', a: 'You own the listing. If for some reason you decide to part ways, the listing is yours. We do not gatekeep anything.' }
