Airbnb just released some impressive numbers from South Carolina that got our attention. The platform generated $2 billion in economic activity across the state in 2024, supported 27,600 jobs, and collected over $517 million in total tax revenue.

But here's what really caught our eye: the data shows exactly what we're seeing with Ontario hosts. Most people aren't running massive rental empires. They're regular folks sharing one home to make ends meet.

## The Reality of Most Airbnb Hosts

The South Carolina numbers paint a picture that looks familiar to anyone managing Ontario short-term rentals. About 78% of hosts there have just one entire home listing. That matches what we see across Ontario, where the vast majority of our clients own one or two properties, not dozens.

Even more telling? These hosts only rent out their places about 37 nights per year. That's roughly three nights per month. We're not talking about hotel-style operations here.

The typical host earned around $16,000 in 2024. For many, that income made the difference between keeping their home or selling it. About 36% of South Carolina hosts said Airbnb helped them stay in their homes despite rising costs.

Sound familiar, Ontario hosts?

## What This Means for Your Rental Strategy

Here's the thing about those South Carolina numbers. They show that successful short-term rentals don't need to be booked solid year-round. Quality over quantity works.

Look at the guest spending patterns. For every $100 spent on Airbnb accommodation, guests spent an additional $261 in the local economy. That's restaurants, shops, attractions, gas stations. When your guests have a great stay, they explore more and spend more.

This is why focusing on guest experience pays off. Happy guests don't just leave good reviews (though they do that too). They become local tourism ambassadors who pump money into your community's economy.

For Ontario hosts, this reinforces something we've been saying for years: you don't need to race to the bottom on pricing or pack your calendar to be profitable. Better to have fewer bookings with higher-quality guests who actually want to explore your area.

## The Tax Revenue Reality Check

Those South Carolina tax numbers are worth paying attention to. Airbnb collected and remitted $70 million in tourism taxes directly. That's on top of the broader $517 million in total tax revenue generated by the economic activity.

Ontario municipalities are watching these numbers too. When short-term rentals generate legitimate tax revenue and economic activity, it's harder for cities to justify overly restrictive regulations.

But this only works when hosts operate above board. Every unlicensed rental or unpaid tax gives ammunition to those who want to shut down the industry entirely.

## Party Prevention Actually Works

One more thing from the South Carolina data that Ontario hosts should know about: Airbnb's party restrictions are working. They've seen a 50% decrease in party reports since implementing their global ban on disruptive parties and events five years ago.

The platform now restricts certain bookings on holidays like New Year's Eve and Halloween. They offer free noise sensors to US hosts (hopefully coming to Canada soon). There's a 24/7 neighborhood support line for complaints.

This matters because party properties hurt all of us. They generate the horror stories that end up in city council meetings when politicians debate new STR restrictions.

## Getting the Most from Your Ontario Rental

The South Carolina data shows that moderate, well-run rentals can be incredibly profitable while supporting local economies. But there's a catch: you need to do it right.

That means proper licensing, consistent guest communication, professional cleaning, and staying on top of local regulations. It means treating your rental like the small business it is, not a passive income stream you can ignore.
