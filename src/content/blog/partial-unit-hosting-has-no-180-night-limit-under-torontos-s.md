Here's something that surprises a lot of Toronto hosts: partial unit hosting doesn't have the same 180-night restriction that entire unit rentals face. But before you get too excited, there's a catch that could make or break your hosting plans.

## What Makes Partial Units Different

Toronto's short-term rental bylaw treats partial units completely differently from entire units. While hosts renting out their entire place can only operate for 180 nights per year, partial unit hosts don't face this restriction at all.

That means you could theoretically host guests year-round in your spare room. Pretty attractive, right?

## The Registration Catch You Can't Ignore

Here's where things get tricky. You can't just decide to call your listing a "partial unit" and bypass the 180-night limit. The city requires you to register properly as a partial unit host, not an entire unit host.

This isn't just paperwork semantics. Get this wrong, and you're operating outside the bylaw requirements.

## You Actually Have to Live There

But here's the bigger catch: you need to actually live in and occupy one of the rooms in your unit. This isn't a loophole where you can rent out bedrooms in an investment property and call it partial hosting.

The bylaw requires genuine home sharing. You're sharing your actual home with guests, not just renting out rooms in a property you own but don't live in.

## What This Means for Different Host Types

**Current Homeowners**: If you live in your place and have a spare room, this could work great for you. No 180-night limit means steady income potential.

**Investment Property Owners**: This probably won't help you. You can't use partial unit registration for properties where you don't actually live.

**Condo Owners**: Remember, your building's rules still apply. Even if the city allows it, your condo corporation might have different restrictions.

## Registration Requirements to Know

When you register with the city, you need to be clear about what type of hosting you're doing. If you register as an entire unit but actually want to do partial hosting later, you'll need to update your registration.

The reverse is true too. You can't register as partial unit hosting if you plan to rent out your entire place when you're away.

## The Income Opportunity

For hosts who can legitimately do partial unit hosting, this opens up significant income potential. Instead of being limited to 180 nights per year, you could host continuously throughout the year in your spare room.

That could mean the difference between a few thousand dollars in annual income and a substantial ongoing revenue stream.

## Stay Compliant with Proper Setup

Look, Toronto's STR bylaws can be confusing. And getting your registration wrong isn't just an administrative headache - it could put your hosting business at risk.

The partial unit hosting option is legitimate and potentially profitable, but only if you meet the actual requirements. You need to live there, register correctly, and follow all the city's rules.
