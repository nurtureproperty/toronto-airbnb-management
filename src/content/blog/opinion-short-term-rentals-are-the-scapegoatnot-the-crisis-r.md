Back in April 2025, Real Estate Magazine Canada published a bold opinion piece defending short-term rentals against what they called unfair blame for Canada's housing crisis. The argument? STRs are getting scapegoated while the real issues get ignored.

Here's why this matters for Ontario hosts today.

## The Scapegoat Argument

The magazine's position was straightforward. Politicians and housing advocates keep pointing fingers at Airbnb hosts while dodging the harder conversations about zoning, development approvals, and supply shortages.

Look, it's easier to blame visible targets like short-term rentals than tackle decades of restrictive zoning policies. The article argued that cities would rather pass STR bans than approve more housing developments.

And honestly? There's some truth to that.

## What The Numbers Actually Show

Here's what the Real Estate Magazine piece highlighted. In most Canadian cities, short-term rentals make up less than 2% of total housing stock. Even if every single Airbnb disappeared tomorrow, we're not solving a housing crisis that needs hundreds of thousands of new units.

But that 2% figure gets weaponized in political debates. It's concrete, it's visible, and it's something councils can actually vote on (unlike fixing the development approval process that takes years).

The article pointed out something interesting. Cities love to announce STR crackdowns because they look proactive. Meanwhile, the same councils approve zero new housing developments and pat themselves on the back.

## Why This Narrative Stuck

So why did STRs become the villain? The magazine identified a few reasons:

**Visibility**. Everyone can see Airbnb listings online. You can't as easily point to zoning restrictions or NIMBY opposition to new builds.

**Quick fixes**. Passing STR regulations takes months. Building new housing takes years. Guess which one politicians prefer?

**Easy blame**. Property investors make convenient targets, especially when renters are struggling to find affordable housing.

The article suggested this scapegoating actually hurts housing policy. Instead of addressing supply issues, cities waste time on regulations that won't meaningfully impact availability.

## What Ontario Hosts Learned

This opinion piece came during a wave of STR restrictions across Ontario. Cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Hamilton all tightened their rules in 2024 and 2025.

But the magazine's argument resonated with many hosts. You're not the problem, they said. You're just the easy target.

That doesn't mean regulations aren't real or that you can ignore them. But it does provide some context for why the industry faced such political pressure.

The piece also highlighted something important for hosts considering [mid-term rental management](/services/mid-term-rental-management-toronto). Longer-term rentals face less political scrutiny, even though they remove the same housing units from the market.

## The Ongoing Reality

Nearly a year later, the debate continues. Some Ontario cities have backed off aggressive STR restrictions after seeing tourism impacts. Others doubled down with stricter licensing and enforcement.

What's clear is that hosts need to stay informed about local regulations, regardless of whether you think they're fair. The political narrative around STRs remains challenging, even if the economic arguments don't always add up.

The magazine's perspective offers a useful counterpoint to the "STRs are destroying housing" narrative. But it doesn't change the fact that you need to comply with whatever rules your city puts in place.

## Playing by The Rules

Whether you agree with the scapegoat argument or not, successful hosts adapt to their regulatory environment. That means proper licensing, following occupancy limits, and maintaining good neighbor relations.
