# Why Your Toronto Airbnb Isn't Making Money (And How to Fix It)

You bought into the dream. Passive income. Your property paying for itself. Maybe even turning a profit while you sleep.

But here you are, three months in, staring at a calendar full of empty nights and wondering where it all went wrong.

You're not alone. We talk to Toronto hosts every week who are frustrated, confused, and honestly a bit embarrassed that their Airbnb isn't performing like they expected. The good news? In almost every case, the problems are fixable.

Here are the 9 most common reasons Toronto Airbnbs fail to make money and exactly what to do about each one.

## 1. Your Photos Look Like They Were Taken in 2015

This is the number one killer of bookings. And it's the easiest to fix.

Guests scroll through hundreds of listings. They spend maybe 3 seconds deciding whether to click on yours. If your photos are dark, cluttered, or shot on an iPhone 6, you've already lost.

We see this constantly: hosts with beautiful properties getting zero bookings because their photos make the place look like a crime scene.

**The fix:** Hire a professional photographer. Seriously. It costs $200 to $400 and will pay for itself within your first few bookings. If you absolutely can't afford that right now, at least shoot during the day with all the lights on, declutter everything, and take wide angle shots from corners.

Check out our [photography service](/services/airbnb-photography) if you want this handled properly.

## 2. Your Pricing Is All Wrong

This one goes both ways. Some hosts price too high and get no bookings. Others price too low, get bookings, but barely cover their costs.

The Toronto market is competitive. A 1-bedroom condo in King West might go for $180/night during TIFF but $95/night in January. If you're charging $150 flat all year, you're leaving money on the table in peak season and sitting empty in the slow months.

**The fix:** Use dynamic pricing. Tools like PriceLabs, Beyond Pricing, or Wheelhouse adjust your rates automatically based on demand, local events, day of week, and seasonality. Or work with a manager who handles this for you.

We use dynamic pricing for all our properties and typically see 20-30% revenue increases just from this one change.

## 3. You're Not Responding Fast Enough

Airbnb's algorithm favors hosts who respond quickly. If you're taking 6 hours to reply to inquiries, you're getting buried in search results. And that potential guest? They've already booked somewhere else.

The data is clear: hosts who respond within an hour get significantly more bookings than those who don't.

**The fix:** Turn on notifications. Set up quick replies for common questions. If you can't be glued to your phone, hire someone to handle guest communication.

Our average response time is 9 minutes. That's not a typo. And it makes a huge difference in conversion rates.

## 4. You're Accepting Guests Who Tank Your Reviews

Every host wants bookings. But accepting every guest who requests, especially those with poor review histories, can cost you more than the revenue is worth.

One problem guest can leave a 3-star review that drags down your average for months. Worse, they might cause damage, disturb neighbours, or violate house rules in ways that create headaches far beyond one stay.

We've seen hosts accept guests with clear warning signs (previous hosts mentioning rule violations, low ratings, vague profiles) because they didn't want an empty night. Then they end up with a bad review that costs them dozens of future bookings.

**The fix:** Check guest profiles and reviews before accepting. Look for patterns, not just the overall rating. If previous hosts mention noise complaints, cleanliness issues, or rule violations, trust that feedback. A few empty nights cost less than a 3-star review that tanks your ranking. Set minimum requirements for verified ID and positive review history.

## 5. Your Listing Description Is Boring (Or Worse, Misleading)

"Nice condo in downtown Toronto. Close to everything."

That describes about 10,000 listings. Why should someone book yours?

Your description needs to paint a picture. What's the vibe? What makes it special? What will guests actually experience?

And please, don't exaggerate. If your "stunning view" is actually a brick wall, guests will mention that in reviews. Trust evaporates fast.

**The fix:** Write like you're telling a friend about the place. Be specific. "Wake up to CN Tower views from the bedroom" beats "great views." Mention the coffee shop downstairs by name. Talk about the heated floors in the bathroom. Details sell.

## 6. Your Reviews Are Hurting You

Anything below 4.5 stars is a problem. Below 4.0? You're basically invisible.

One bad review can tank your ranking for weeks. And if you've got a pattern of complaints about cleanliness, communication, or accuracy, Airbnb's algorithm notices.

**The fix:** Read your reviews carefully. What are guests actually complaining about? Fix those things first. Then focus on getting more positive reviews by providing a great experience and following up with happy guests.

If cleanliness is the issue, hire professional cleaners. If communication is the problem, respond faster or get help. If accuracy is the issue, update your listing to match reality.

See our [cleaning services](/services/airbnb-cleaning) for help with the cleanliness piece.

## 7. You're Only on Airbnb

Airbnb is the biggest platform, but it's not the only one. VRBO, Booking.com, and Expedia all have travelers who never check Airbnb.

By listing on one platform, you're missing a chunk of potential guests.

**The fix:** List on multiple platforms. Use a channel manager to sync calendars and avoid double bookings. This takes some setup, but it can increase your occupancy by 15-25%.

## 8. Your Location Description Doesn't Help Guests

"Close to downtown" means nothing. How close? Which part of downtown? Can I walk to the Rogers Centre? Is there parking?

Guests are trying to figure out if your location works for their trip. If they can't tell, they'll book somewhere else.

**The fix:** Be specific about your location. Mention exact distances to landmarks, transit options, parking availability, and nearby attractions. "5 minute walk to St. Andrew subway station" is useful. "Close to transit" is not.

If you're in a great neighbourhood, show it off. Link to our [Downtown Toronto](/downtown-toronto-airbnb-management) or [North York](/north-york-airbnb-management) pages to see how we highlight location advantages.

## 9. You're Doing Everything Yourself (And Burning Out)

Managing an Airbnb is a job. Guest messages at midnight. Cleaning coordination. Restocking supplies. Handling complaints. Dealing with maintenance emergencies.

Some hosts try to do it all themselves to "save money" on management fees. But they end up exhausted, their response times slip, their cleaning quality drops, and their reviews suffer.

The math often doesn't work out. You save 15% on management but lose 30% in bookings because you can't keep up.

**The fix:** Be honest about your capacity. If you have a full time job and a family, you probably don't have time to manage an Airbnb properly. Either commit the time or get help.

Our [full management service](/full-airbnb-management-toronto) handles everything for 10-15% of revenue. Most hosts actually make more money with us than they did on their own, even after our fee.

## The Real Problem Might Be Simpler Than You Think

Here's what we've learned after managing properties across the GTA: most underperforming Airbnbs have one or two fixable problems, not ten.

Sometimes it's just the photos. Sometimes it's pricing. Sometimes it's a cleanliness issue that keeps showing up in reviews.

The challenge is figuring out which problem is actually hurting you.

## What To Do Next

If your Toronto Airbnb isn't making money, start here:

1. Look at your photos honestly. Would you book this place?
2. Check your pricing against similar listings in your area
3. Read your last 10 reviews. What patterns do you see?
4. Check your response time and Instant Book status
5. Be honest about whether you have time to do this right

If you want a professional opinion, we offer free property analyses. We'll look at your listing, tell you exactly what's hurting your performance, and give you specific recommendations.

No sales pitch. Just honest feedback.
