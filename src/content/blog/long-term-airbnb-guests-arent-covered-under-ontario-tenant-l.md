Here's some news that'll make Ontario Airbnb hosts breathe easier. The Landlord and Tenant Board just ruled that long-term Airbnb guests don't automatically become tenants under Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.

This isn't just legal jargon. It's a ruling that could save you from months of headaches if you've got extended-stay guests.

## What Actually Happened

The case involved an Airbnb guest who stayed for several months and then claimed tenant rights when the host wanted them out. You know the nightmare scenario we've all worried about. Guest books for a week, extends to a month, then suddenly they're claiming they live there and can't be evicted.

Well, the Landlord and Tenant Board said no. They ruled that just because someone stays in your Airbnb for a long time doesn't make them a tenant with all the protections that come with it.

## The Grey Area Nobody Talks About

Here's the thing though. This doesn't mean you're completely in the clear if someone camps out in your property for six months.

The Board looked at several factors:
- The original booking was clearly for temporary accommodation
- Payment was made through Airbnb's platform
- There was no traditional landlord-tenant relationship established
- The guest knew it was short-term rental accommodation

But what if those lines get blurry? What if someone books month-to-month and starts getting mail delivered there?

## Why This Matters for Your Rental

Look, most of us have had those guests who want to extend their stay. Maybe it's a work contract that got extended, or they're between homes. Sometimes it makes financial sense to say yes.

This ruling gives you more protection when you do accept longer bookings. But it doesn't give you a free pass to ignore how those arrangements are structured.

## The Smart Way to Handle Extended Stays

So what should you do if someone wants to stay for two months? Here's what I'd recommend:

Keep everything through Airbnb's platform when possible. The ruling specifically mentioned that payments through Airbnb helped establish this wasn't a traditional rental.

Document the temporary nature of the stay. Make it clear in your communications that this is still short-term accommodation, even if it's for several weeks.

Consider your local regulations too. Some Ontario cities have rules about how long short-term rentals can operate. This Board ruling doesn't override those local laws.

## The Bigger Picture for Ontario STR Regulations

This ruling actually shows how the legal system is starting to understand that short-term rentals are different from traditional rentals. That's good news for the industry overall.

But don't get too comfortable. Ontario STR regulations are still evolving, and each municipality is handling things differently. What works in Toronto might not fly in Ottawa or Hamilton.

## When Extended Stays Make Sense

Honestly, longer bookings can be great for your business. Less turnover, steady income, lower cleaning costs. The sweet spot seems to be those 2-4 week stays from business travelers or people relocating.

Just make sure you're structuring these arrangements properly. If you're consistently hosting people for months at a time, you might want to consider [mid-term rental management](/services/mid-term-rental-management-toronto) as a separate business model.

## What About Your Insurance?

Here's something the ruling doesn't address. Your insurance company might have different ideas about what constitutes short-term vs. long-term hosting. Check your policy before accepting extended bookings.

Most STR insurance policies have limits on how long individual guests can stay. Going over those limits could leave you exposed if something goes wrong.

## The Bottom Line

This ruling is good news for Ontario hosts, but it's not a magic shield. You still need to be smart about how you handle extended stays and know your local regulations.

The key takeaway? Structure your longer bookings properly, keep good documentation, and don't assume this ruling covers every possible scenario.
