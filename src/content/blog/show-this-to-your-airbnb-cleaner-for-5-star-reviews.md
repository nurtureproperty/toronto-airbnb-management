Want to know the difference between an amateur Airbnb host and someone who consistently gets rave reviews? It's often the tiny details that cost nothing but leave a huge impression.

Here's a perfect example: how you leave your toilet paper.

## The Four Levels of Airbnb Toilet Paper

Most hosts don't think twice about toilet paper presentation. Big mistake. Here's how different host levels handle this simple detail:

**Amateur Level:** Just leave it hanging there. Nothing special, nothing memorable.

**Level 2:** Make sure it's properly positioned and accessible.

**Level 3:** Add a simple fold or point to the end.

**Level 4:** Create a decorative fold with a little bow that makes guests smile.

Guess which one gets mentioned in reviews?

## How to Create the "Level 4" Toilet Paper Fold

This takes your cleaner about 30 seconds per bathroom. Here's the technique:

Start by pulling down two sheets of toilet paper, then one additional sheet. Roll the longer section into a very thin strip. Now fold this strip into a small triangle shape.

Take the two-sheet section and create a simple fold. The result? A cute little bow that transforms an ordinary bathroom into something that feels more upscale.

## Why Small Details Matter More Than You Think

Look, your guests aren't going to book your place because of how you fold toilet paper. But they absolutely will remember it when they're writing their review.

This tiny touch signals that someone cares about their experience. It suggests attention to detail throughout the property. And honestly, in Toronto's competitive short-term rental market, these small differentiators can make or break your success.

The best part? It doesn't cost you anything extra. Just train your cleaning team to spend an extra minute per bathroom on this finishing touch.

## Training Your Cleaning Team

Share this technique with your [short-term rental management](/services/short-term-rental-management-toronto) team or cleaning crew. Most cleaners want to do great work, they just need to know what "great" looks like in your book.

Show them the difference between amateur and professional presentation. Explain that these details directly impact your reviews, which affects your booking rate, which affects everyone's income.

Here's what else you can train them to do:
- Fan out the towels nicely instead of just folding them
- Arrange pillows with intention, not just toss them on the bed
- Leave the coffee mugs facing the same direction
- Position the TV remote in an obvious, accessible spot

## The Psychology Behind Guest Expectations

Your guests are paying premium prices to stay in your Toronto Airbnb. They expect something different from a hotel experience, something more personal and thoughtful.

These small touches create that "wow" moment when they first walk in. They pull out their phones to take pictures. They text their friends about the cute details.

And when checkout time comes, they remember how the place made them feel. That's what shows up in your reviews.

## Small Effort, Big Returns

The toilet paper bow trick represents something bigger about successful hosting. It's not about expensive upgrades or fancy amenities. It's about caring enough to sweat the small stuff.

Your guests notice when you go the extra mile on details that don't cost money. They appreciate thoughtfulness over flashiness.

So next time your cleaning team finishes a turnover, have them do a final walk-through with this question: "Does this look like a space where someone cares about the guest experience?"

That toilet paper fold is a simple way to answer "yes" before guests even ask the question.
