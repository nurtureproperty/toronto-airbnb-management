Toronto homeowners with basement apartments have more options than you might think. While the city's STR rules have specific requirements, savvy hosts across the GTA are finding legitimate ways to generate income from their properties.

Here's what Toronto hosts are actually doing with their basement apartments, and how you can make the most of your property.

## Understanding Toronto's Basement Rules

Toronto's short-term rental bylaws require that you rent out your "principal residence" for short-term stays. This means you can't list a basement apartment as a completely separate Airbnb if you don't live there.

But here's the good news: if you live in the house, you have several great options for generating income from your basement space.

The key is understanding what "principal residence" actually means and structuring your rental approach accordingly.

## What Toronto Hosts Are Actually Doing

Understanding what other hosts are doing can help you think through your own strategy. Here's what we're seeing across the GTA:

**Whole-house listings with basement included.** Many hosts are listing their entire property (main floor + basement) as a single rental. When they travel or stay elsewhere temporarily, guests get the whole house. This works well for hosts who can be flexible about when they're home.

**Partial-unit rentals while living upstairs.** Some homeowners live on the main floor and rent the basement to guests while they're home. This qualifies as a [partial-unit registration](/blog/toronto-airbnb-partial-unit-registration-guide-2026), which has no 180-night limit. You can do this 365 days a year.

**Creative positioning.** Hosts are using terms like "lower level suite," "garden level," or "private entrance accommodation" rather than "basement apartment" in their listings. This better reflects the guest experience and avoids any confusion about the property setup.

## The Smartest Approach: Partial-Unit Registration

If you live in your house and want to rent the basement, partial-unit registration is often your best path. Here's why:

- **No night limit** - Unlike entire-home rentals capped at 180 nights, partial-unit rentals have no annual limit
- **You're home anyway** - Easy to manage issues, greet guests, and maintain quality
- **Simpler setup** - Insurance and compliance are straightforward when you're on-site
- **Better reviews** - Guests appreciate having a responsive host nearby

We've seen hosts in the Beaches, High Park, and Leslieville do really well with this model. One client with a finished basement in the Danforth area consistently earns $2,800-3,200/month.

## Mid-Term Rentals: The Underrated Option

Don't overlook mid-term rentals (28+ days). They're completely exempt from Toronto's short-term rental rules, which means:

- No registration required
- No night limits
- Works even if the basement is a separate unit

Corporate travelers, students, and people relocating to Toronto need furnished monthly rentals. The demand is strong, and you'll often get more reliable income than chasing weekend bookings.

Our [mid-term rental management service](/services/mid-term-rental-management) handles everything from marketing to guest screening. Many hosts find this approach less work with similar returns.

## Locations with More Flexibility

If you own property outside Toronto proper, you may have more options. Different GTA municipalities have different rules:

- **Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan** - Each has its own STR regulations
- **Some areas have no principal residence requirement** - Check your specific municipality
- **Durham Region** - Several cities are still developing their rules

Check our [city-specific guides](/blog) for details on regulations in your area.

## Making It Work for You

The best approach depends on your specific situation:

**If you live in the house:** Consider partial-unit registration for your basement. You can rent year-round with no restrictions on nights.

**If it's an investment property:** Mid-term rentals (28+ days) are your best bet. Strong demand, good returns, and no STR rules to navigate.

**If you want maximum flexibility:** Whole-house rentals when you travel, partial-unit when you're home. Mix and match based on your schedule.

## Getting Started the Right Way

The key to success is setting up your rental correctly from the start. Register with the city, choose the right registration type for your situation, and structure your listing to reflect how you're actually operating.
