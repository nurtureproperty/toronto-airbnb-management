# First Time Airbnb Host in Toronto: Everything You Need to Know

So you're thinking about starting an Airbnb in Toronto. Maybe you've got a spare room. Maybe you're away for work half the year. Maybe you just bought a condo and the mortgage is heavier than expected.

Whatever brought you here, you've got questions. Lots of them.

Is it legal? How much can I actually make? What do I need to get started? What are the mistakes that sink new hosts?

This guide covers everything. No fluff. Just the stuff you actually need to know before you list your first property.

## Is Airbnb Legal in Toronto?

Yes. But there are rules.

Toronto legalized short term rentals in 2020 with specific regulations. Here's what you need to know:

**The principal residence rule:** You can only operate a short term rental in your principal residence. That means the home where you actually live. You can't buy an investment condo and Airbnb it full time. The city will check, and the fines are steep.

**The 180 night cap:** If you're renting out your entire home while you're away, you're limited to 180 nights per year. Renting a spare room while you're home? No cap.

**Registration required:** You must register with the City of Toronto and display your registration number on your listing. No registration, no legal operation.

**The 4% Municipal Accommodation Tax:** You'll collect this from guests and remit it to the city. Airbnb handles this automatically in most cases.

If you're in a condo, check your condo corporation's rules too. Some buildings prohibit short term rentals entirely, regardless of what the city allows. We've got a list of [444 Toronto condos that allow STRs](/blog/toronto-condos-allow-short-term-rentals) if you're trying to figure out what's permitted.

## How to Register Your Toronto Airbnb

Here's the process:

1. Go to the City of Toronto's Short Term Rental Registration portal
2. Create an account and complete the application
3. Pay the $50 annual registration fee
4. Provide proof that the property is your principal residence (utility bills, tax documents, etc.)
5. Get your registration number
6. Add the registration number to your Airbnb listing

The whole process takes about 2 to 3 weeks if your documents are in order.

One more thing: you'll need to renew annually and pay the fee each year.

If this sounds like a hassle, we can handle the registration process for you as part of our [management services](/services/short-term-rental-management-toronto).

## What Will It Cost to Get Started?

Let's be realistic about startup costs. Here's what most new Toronto hosts spend:

**Essential costs:**
- City registration fee: $50/year
- Professional photography: $200 to $400
- Basic supplies (linens, towels, toiletries): $300 to $800
- Smart lock: $150 to $300
- Smoke and CO detectors (if needed): $50 to $100

**Nice to have:**
- Furniture upgrades: $500 to $2,000+
- Decor and styling: $200 to $500
- Welcome basket items: $50 to $100
- Lockbox (backup): $30 to $50

**Total range:** $750 to $3,500+ depending on how much your place needs.

The biggest variable is furniture and decor. If your place is already well furnished, you're looking at the lower end. If you need to buy beds, couches, and kitchen essentials, budget accordingly.

## How Much Can You Actually Make?

This is the question everyone asks. And the honest answer is: it depends.

A downtown 1-bedroom condo might earn $2,500 to $4,000/month with good occupancy. A spare room in North York might bring in $800 to $1,500/month. A whole house near the waterfront during TIFF or Caribana could pull $500+ per night.

Here are the factors that matter:

**Location:** Downtown, waterfront, and trendy neighbourhoods command premium rates. Suburban locations need to compete more on price.

**Property type:** Entire homes earn more per night than private rooms. Unique properties (lofts, heritage homes, places with views) can charge premiums.

**Seasonality:** Toronto has clear peak seasons. Summer is busy. September (TIFF) is gold. Winter is slow. Your annual average depends on how you handle the slow months.

**Your effort level:** Hosts who optimize pricing, respond quickly, and maintain high review scores earn significantly more than those who set and forget.

A realistic expectation for a well managed 1-bedroom downtown condo: $30,000 to $45,000/year gross revenue. After expenses (cleaning, supplies, platform fees, management if applicable), net income is typically 60-70% of gross.

## Setting Up Your Space

Your space needs to be guest ready. That means comfortable, clean, functional, and equipped with everything a traveler needs.

**The bedroom:**
- Quality mattress (this is not the place to cheap out)
- Fresh, hotel quality linens (white is classic and easy to bleach)
- Blackout curtains
- Multiple pillows
- Bedside tables with lamps
- Phone chargers

**The bathroom:**
- Fresh towels (at least 2 per guest)
- Basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap)
- Hair dryer
- Toilet paper (extra rolls visible)
- First aid kit
- Cleaning supplies under the sink

**The kitchen:**
- Coffee maker (this is mandatory in Toronto)
- Basic cookware and utensils
- Dishes and glasses for your max guest count
- Salt, pepper, oil, and a few pantry basics
- Dish soap and sponge
- Paper towels

**General:**
- Fast, reliable wifi (test it, guests will complain if it's slow)
- TV with streaming capability
- Iron and ironing board
- Extra blankets
- Clear checkout instructions
- Local guidebook or recommendations

**Safety (required):**
- Working smoke detectors on every level
- Carbon monoxide detector
- Fire extinguisher
- First aid kit
- Emergency contact information posted

Don't overlook the details. Guests notice when there's no can opener, when the wifi password is hard to find, when the shower pressure is weak. Fix the small stuff before it becomes a bad review.

## Creating Your Listing

Your listing is your sales page. It needs to do three things: grab attention, build trust, and answer questions.

**Photos first:** Get professional photos. We've said it before, we'll say it again. This is the single most important factor in getting bookings. A professional photographer costs $200 to $400 and will pay for itself quickly. See our [photography service](/services/airbnb-photography-toronto) if you want help.

**Title that stands out:** Skip generic titles like "Nice condo downtown." Be specific and highlight your best feature. "CN Tower Views from Bed - King West 1BR" tells guests something useful.

**Description that sells:** Write like you're telling a friend about the place. Be specific. Mention the neighbourhood by name. Talk about what guests will experience, not just what the space has. And be honest. Overpromising leads to bad reviews.

**Amenities:** Check every amenity that applies. Guests filter by amenities, so missing checkboxes means missing bookings. Wifi, kitchen, washer/dryer, AC, heating, workspace. List everything.

**House rules:** Be clear but not aggressive. State your expectations around noise, smoking, parties, and checkout. Reasonable rules are fine. A 47 point list of restrictions will scare guests away.

**Pricing:** Start slightly below market to get your first few reviews. Once you have 5+ positive reviews, raise your rates. Use dynamic pricing to adjust automatically for demand.

## The Mistakes New Hosts Make

We've seen hundreds of new hosts get started. Here are the patterns that cause problems:

**Underpricing for too long.** It's smart to start low to get reviews. It's not smart to stay low forever. Once you have 5 to 10 solid reviews, raise your rates to market level.

**Skipping professional photos.** Your cousin with an iPhone is not a professional photographer. This one decision will cost you thousands in lost bookings over time.

**Responding too slowly.** Airbnb rewards fast responders with better search placement. Guests book with whoever responds first. If you're taking 6 hours to reply, you're losing bookings.

**Not using Instant Book.** Some new hosts want to approve every guest manually. This kills your search visibility. Turn on Instant Book with guest requirements and watch your bookings increase.

**Ignoring the details.** No toilet paper under the sink. Complicated wifi instructions. A coffee maker with no coffee. These small misses add up to mediocre reviews.

**Trying to do everything yourself.** Managing an Airbnb is a part time job. If you have a full time career and a family, something will slip. Either commit the time or get help.

**Not understanding the regulations.** Operating without registration, exceeding the 180 night cap, or violating condo rules can result in fines of $10,000+ per day. Know the rules before you start.

## Should You Manage It Yourself or Hire Help?

Be honest with yourself about a few things:

**Your time:** Can you respond to messages within an hour, any time of day? Can you coordinate cleaners on short notice? Can you handle a maintenance emergency at 2am?

**Your location:** Do you live close enough to handle issues in person? If you're 45 minutes away, how will you deal with a lockout or a broken pipe?

**Your tolerance:** Do you enjoy hospitality and guest interaction? Or does the thought of dealing with complaints make you want to run?

If you've got the time, live nearby, and genuinely enjoy hosting, self management can work. You'll keep more of the revenue and have full control.

If you're busy, live far away, or just want passive income without the hassle, professional management makes sense. You'll pay 10 to 25% of revenue (we charge 10-15%), but you'll also likely earn more because a professional manager optimizes pricing, responds faster, and maintains higher review scores.

Our [full management service](/services/full-airbnb-management-toronto) handles everything: listing creation, pricing, guest communication, cleaning, maintenance, and more. Most hosts actually net more money with us than they did on their own, even after our fee.

## Getting Your First Reviews

Reviews are everything on Airbnb. A new listing with zero reviews is at a disadvantage. Here's how to get momentum:

**Price low initially.** Your first 3 to 5 bookings should be priced below market. You're buying reviews, essentially. Once you have social proof, raise your rates.

**Overdeliver.** For your first guests, go above and beyond. Welcome basket. Handwritten note. Restaurant recommendations. Make them want to leave a great review.

**Ask for reviews.** After checkout, send a friendly message thanking them and mentioning that you'd appreciate a review if they have a moment. Most guests won't review unless prompted.

**Respond to all reviews.** Even short responses show future guests that you're engaged and attentive.

**Fix problems immediately.** If early guests mention issues, fix them before the next booking. Patterns of complaints will sink your listing.

## What to Expect in Year One

Here's a realistic timeline for a new Toronto Airbnb host:

**Month 1:** Listing goes live. You're priced low to get initial bookings. Maybe 40 to 50% occupancy. You're learning the rhythm of hosting.

**Months 2 to 3:** First reviews come in. You've identified and fixed initial issues. Occupancy improves to 50 to 60%. You raise prices slightly.

**Months 4 to 6:** You're getting the hang of it. Reviews are solid. You've optimized your listing based on what guests mention. Occupancy hits 60 to 70% in good months.

**Months 7 to 12:** You understand seasonality. You know your peak months (summer, TIFF, holidays) and slow months (January, February). You're adjusting pricing accordingly. Annual revenue picture becomes clear.

Most hosts don't hit their stride until month 4 to 6. Don't panic if the first few months are slow. It takes time to build reviews and figure out what works.

## Ready to Get Started?

Starting an Airbnb in Toronto is absolutely doable. The regulations are manageable. The market is strong. And with the right approach, you can build a meaningful income stream from your property.

Here's your checklist:

1. Confirm your property qualifies (principal residence, condo rules)
2. Register with the City of Toronto
3. Set up your space with guest essentials
4. Get professional photos
5. Create a compelling listing
6. Price competitively to get initial reviews
7. Respond fast and provide great hospitality
8. Optimize based on feedback
