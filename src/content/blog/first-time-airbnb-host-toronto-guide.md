# First Time Airbnb Host in Toronto: Step-by-Step Guide

So you're thinking about starting an Airbnb in Toronto. Maybe you've got a spare room. Maybe you're away for work half the year. Maybe you just bought a condo and the mortgage is heavier than expected.

Whatever brought you here, you've got questions. Lots of them.

Is it legal? How much can I actually make? What do I need to get started? What are the mistakes that sink new hosts?

This guide walks you through everything step by step. No fluff. Just what you need to know to get your first property listed and earning.

## Step 1: Confirm You're Eligible to Host

Before you do anything else, make sure you can legally operate a short term rental in Toronto. Get this wrong and you're facing fines up to **$100,000**.

**Check the principal residence rule.** You can only operate a short term rental in your principal residence - the home where you actually live. You cannot buy an investment condo and Airbnb it full time. The city verifies this through tax records, ID, and utility bills. Read our [complete Toronto STR regulations guide](/blog/toronto-airbnb-short-term-rental-regulations-2026) for full details.

**Understand the 180 night limit (and how to avoid it).** If you're renting out your entire home while you're away (entire-unit rental), you're limited to 180 nights per calendar year. But here's what many hosts don't know: **partial-unit rentals have no night limit**. If you rent a spare room while you're home, you can operate 365 nights/year. Our [partial-unit registration guide](/blog/toronto-airbnb-partial-unit-registration-guide-2026) explains how this works.

**Know about the MAT tax.** Toronto charges an **8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax** on all short-term rentals. Airbnb collects and remits this automatically, but it affects your net revenue. See our [MAT tax guide](/blog/toronto-airbnb-mat-tax-guide-2026) for details.

**Check your condo rules.** Even if the city allows STRs, your condo corporation may prohibit them. Review your declaration and rules, or ask your property manager. We've got a list of [444 Toronto condos that allow STRs](/blog/toronto-condos-that-allow-airbnb-short-term-rental) if you're trying to figure out what's permitted.

## Step 2: Register With the City of Toronto

Registration is mandatory. You cannot legally advertise or operate without it.

**How to register:**

1. Go to the City of Toronto's Short Term Rental Registration portal at toronto.ca/str
2. Create an account and complete the application form
3. Indicate whether you'll operate an entire-unit or partial-unit rental (this is locked for the year)
4. Pay the registration fee
5. Submit proof that the property is your principal residence (government ID, utility bills, tax documents)
6. Wait for approval (typically 2 to 3 weeks if documents are in order)
7. Receive your registration number
8. Add your registration number to all listings and advertisements

**Important details:**
- Registration is valid for one year and must be renewed annually
- You can only hold one registration at a time (one principal residence)
- Your registration is tied to your specific address and rental type
- The Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT) applies to all bookings. Airbnb collects and remits this automatically.

If this sounds like a hassle, we can handle the registration process for you as part of our [management services](/services/short-term-rental-management-toronto).

## Step 3: Budget for Startup Costs

Here's what most new Toronto hosts spend to get started:

**Essential costs:**
- City registration fee (check toronto.ca for current amount)
- Professional photography: $200 to $400
- Basic supplies (linens, towels, toiletries): $300 to $800
- Smart lock: $150 to $300
- Smoke and CO detectors (if needed): $50 to $100

**Nice to have:**
- Furniture upgrades: $500 to $2,000+
- Decor and styling: $200 to $500
- Welcome basket items: $50 to $100
- Lockbox (backup): $30 to $50

**Total range:** $700 to $3,500+ depending on how much your place needs.

The biggest variable is furniture and decor. If your place is already well furnished, you're looking at the lower end. If you need to buy beds, couches, and kitchen essentials, budget accordingly.

## Step 4: Understand Your Earning Potential

This is the question everyone asks. And the honest answer is: it depends. But we have real data.

We recently [analyzed 320 Toronto 2-bedroom Airbnb listings](/blog/how-to-make-more-from-toronto-airbnb) to understand what hosts actually earn. Here's what the data shows:

**The median 2-bedroom earns $1,610/month.** That's the middle of the pack. But the range is dramatic:
- **Bottom 10%:** Under $289/month (often inactive or poorly optimized)
- **Top 25%:** $3,497/month or more
- **Top 10%:** $5,649/month or more
- **Top performer:** $12,111/month

That's a 42x gap between the best and worst performers. What separates them? Mostly optimization factors you can control.

**What actually drives revenue:**

| Factor | Impact on Revenue |
|--------|------------------|
| Dynamic pricing (high) | +64% vs no pricing tools |
| Guest Favorite badge | +104% premium |
| 100+ reviews vs &lt;10 | +258% more revenue |
| 5 guests vs 4 guests | +31% higher earnings |
| 2+ bathrooms vs 1 | +22% premium |

**Seasonality matters:** Toronto has clear peak seasons. Summer is busy. September (TIFF) is gold. Winter is slow. Hosts using dynamic pricing tools capture premium rates during peaks and avoid sitting empty during slow periods.

**For larger properties:** If you're renting a 5-bedroom house in Scarborough, Pickering, or Ajax, the numbers look different. Our [GTA 5-bedroom analysis](/blog/how-to-make-more-from-gta-airbnb) shows median revenue of $1,984/month, with amenities like pools (+96%) and hot tubs (+65%) making massive differences.

A realistic expectation for a well-managed 2-bedroom downtown condo: $25,000 to $45,000/year gross revenue. After expenses (cleaning, supplies, platform fees, management if applicable), net income is typically 60-70% of gross.

## Step 5: Set Up Your Space

Your space needs to be guest ready. That means comfortable, clean, functional, and equipped with everything a traveler needs.

**The bedroom:**
- Quality mattress (this is not the place to cheap out)
- Fresh, hotel quality linens (white is classic and easy to bleach)
- Blackout curtains
- Multiple pillows
- Bedside tables with lamps
- Phone chargers

**The bathroom:**
- Fresh towels (at least 2 per guest)
- Basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap)
- Hair dryer
- Toilet paper (extra rolls visible)
- First aid kit
- Cleaning supplies under the sink

**The kitchen:**
- Coffee maker (this is mandatory in Toronto)
- Basic cookware and utensils
- Dishes and glasses for your max guest count
- Salt, pepper, oil, and a few pantry basics
- Dish soap and sponge
- Paper towels

**General:**
- Fast, reliable wifi (test it, guests will complain if it's slow)
- TV with streaming capability
- Iron and ironing board
- Extra blankets
- Clear checkout instructions
- Local guidebook or recommendations (see our [Airbnb welcome book template](/blog/airbnb-welcome-book-template-guide-2026) for a complete section-by-section guide)

**Safety (required):**
- Working smoke detectors on every level
- Carbon monoxide detector
- Fire extinguisher
- First aid kit
- Emergency contact information posted

Don't overlook the details. Guests notice when there's no can opener, when the wifi password is hard to find, when the shower pressure is weak. Fix the small stuff before it becomes a bad review.

## Step 6: Create Your Listing

Your listing is your sales page. It needs to do three things: grab attention, build trust, and answer questions.

**Photos first:** Get professional photos. We've said it before, we'll say it again. This is the single most important factor in getting bookings. A professional photographer costs $200 to $400 and will pay for itself quickly. See our [complete Airbnb photography guide](/blog/airbnb-photography-guide-toronto-2026) for staging tips, DIY technique, and what rooms to prioritize, or visit our [photography service](/services/airbnb-photography) if you want it handled for you.

**Title that stands out:** Skip generic titles like "Nice condo downtown." Be specific and highlight your best feature. "CN Tower Views from Bed - King West 1BR" tells guests something useful.

**Description that sells:** Write like you're telling a friend about the place. Be specific. Mention the neighbourhood by name. Talk about what guests will experience, not just what the space has. And be honest. Overpromising leads to bad reviews.

**Amenities:** Check every amenity that applies. Guests filter by amenities, so missing checkboxes means missing bookings. Wifi, kitchen, washer/dryer, AC, heating, workspace. List everything.

**House rules:** Be clear but not aggressive. State your expectations around noise, smoking, parties, and checkout. Reasonable rules are fine. A 47 point list of restrictions will scare guests away.

**Pricing:** Start slightly below market to get your first few reviews. Once you have 5+ positive reviews, raise your rates.

**Use dynamic pricing tools.** This is non-negotiable. Our data shows hosts using high-intensity dynamic pricing earn **64% more** than those with static pricing ($3,303/month vs $2,020/month for 2-bedrooms). Tools like PriceLabs, Wheelhouse, or Airbnb's Smart Pricing automatically adjust your rates for TIFF, Caribana, holidays, and slow seasons. This single decision can add thousands to your annual income.

## Step 7: Avoid the Common Mistakes

We've seen hundreds of new hosts get started. Here are the patterns that cause problems:

**Underpricing for too long.** It's smart to start low to get reviews. It's not smart to stay low forever. Once you have 5 to 10 solid reviews, raise your rates to market level. The data shows listings with strict cancellation policies (a sign of established properties) earn **139% more** than those with flexible policies.

**Skipping professional photos.** Your cousin with an iPhone is not a professional photographer. This one decision will cost you thousands in lost bookings over time. Listings that earn the Guest Favorite badge (which requires great photos and reviews) earn **104% more** than those without.

**Responding too slowly.** Airbnb rewards fast responders with better search placement. Guests book with whoever responds first. If you're taking 6 hours to reply, you're losing bookings. Our average response time is 9 minutes - that's the standard to beat.

**Not using dynamic pricing.** Hosts with high-intensity dynamic pricing earn **64% more** than those with static rates. This is one of the biggest revenue levers you have. Don't leave money on the table during TIFF, Caribana, or summer weekends.

**Not using Instant Book.** Some new hosts want to approve every guest manually. This kills your search visibility. Turn on Instant Book with guest requirements and watch your bookings increase.

**Ignoring the details.** No toilet paper under the sink. Complicated wifi instructions. A coffee maker with no coffee. These small misses add up to mediocre reviews. And reviews compound: listings with 100+ reviews earn **$4,684/month** vs just **$1,307/month** for listings with fewer than 10 reviews.

**Trying to do everything yourself.** Managing an Airbnb is a part time job. If you have a full time career and a family, something will slip. Either commit the time or get help.

**Not understanding the regulations.** Operating without registration, exceeding the 180 night cap, or violating condo rules can result in fines up to **$100,000**. Toronto also charges an **8.5% Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT)** on all bookings - Airbnb collects this automatically, but you need to understand how it affects your net revenue. Read our [complete Toronto regulations guide](/blog/toronto-airbnb-short-term-rental-regulations-2026) and [MAT tax guide](/blog/toronto-airbnb-mat-tax-guide-2026) before you start.

## Step 8: Decide on Self-Management vs Professional Help

Be honest with yourself about a few things:

**Your time:** Can you respond to messages within an hour, any time of day? Can you coordinate cleaners on short notice? Can you handle a maintenance emergency at 2am?

**Your location:** Do you live close enough to handle issues in person? If you're 45 minutes away, how will you deal with a lockout or a broken pipe?

**Your tolerance:** Do you enjoy hospitality and guest interaction? Or does the thought of dealing with complaints make you want to run?

If you've got the time, live nearby, and genuinely enjoy hosting, self management can work. You'll keep more of the revenue and have full control.

If you're busy, live far away, or just want passive income without the hassle, professional management makes sense. You'll pay 10 to 25% of revenue (we charge 10-15%), but you'll also likely earn more because a professional manager optimizes pricing, responds faster, and maintains higher review scores.

Our [full management service](/full-airbnb-management-toronto) handles everything: listing creation, pricing, guest communication, cleaning, maintenance, and more. Most hosts actually net more money with us than they did on their own, even after our fee.

## Step 9: Get Your First Reviews

Reviews are everything on Airbnb. A new listing with zero reviews is at a massive disadvantage. The data proves it:

| Review Count | Average Monthly Revenue |
|-------------|------------------------|
| No reviews | $674/month |
| 1-10 reviews | $1,307/month |
| 11-30 reviews | $2,586/month |
| 31-50 reviews | $3,855/month |
| 100+ reviews | $4,684/month |

That's a **595% difference** between zero reviews and 100+ reviews. Every single review you earn is worth real money.

**Price low initially.** Your first 3 to 5 bookings should be priced below market. You're buying reviews, essentially. Once you have social proof, raise your rates.

**Overdeliver.** For your first guests, go above and beyond. Welcome basket. Handwritten note. Restaurant recommendations. Make them want to leave a great review.

**Ask for reviews.** After checkout, send a friendly message thanking them and mentioning that you'd appreciate a review if they have a moment. Most guests won't review unless prompted.

**Respond to all reviews.** Even short responses show future guests that you're engaged and attentive.

**Work toward the Guest Favorite badge.** Once you have enough reviews and consistently high ratings, you can earn Airbnb's Guest Favorite badge. Our data shows listings with this badge earn **104% more** than those without. It's the single most valuable badge you can earn.

**Fix problems immediately.** If early guests mention issues, fix them before the next booking. Patterns of complaints will sink your listing.

## Skip the Learning Curve: Work With Us

Here's the truth about year one as a new host: it's a learning curve.

You'll figure out pricing through trial and error. You'll learn which guest inquiries are red flags. You'll discover that your cleaning schedule needs adjustment after a few turnovers go sideways. You'll realize that responding to messages at 11pm gets old fast.

Most self-managing hosts don't hit their stride until month 4 to 6. That's months of suboptimal pricing, missed bookings, and lessons learned the hard way.

**You don't have to do it that way.**

When you work with Nurture, you skip the learning curve entirely. We bring years of Toronto-specific hosting experience to your property from day one:

- **Dynamic pricing** that adjusts for TIFF, Caribana, holidays, and slow seasons, so you're never leaving money on the table or sitting empty
- **9-minute average response time** that keeps Airbnb's algorithm happy and converts more inquiries into bookings
- **Guest screening** that protects your property and your reviews
- **Cleaning coordination** so turnovers happen reliably, every time
- **Listing optimization** based on what actually works in the Toronto market

Our hosts typically see 30-100% higher revenue compared to what they were earning on their own. And that's after our 10-15% fee.

The math is simple: you can spend six months figuring it out yourself, or you can start earning at full potential from week one.

## Ready to Get Started?

Starting an Airbnb in Toronto is absolutely doable. The regulations are manageable. The market is strong. And with the right approach, you can build a meaningful income stream from your property.

3. Set up your space with guest essentials
