Good news for Toronto Airbnb hosts: FIFA World Cup 2026 is shaping up to be a goldmine.

A [new Deloitte report](https://news.airbnb.com/special-event-hosting-rules-urged-in-vancouver-during-fifa/) on Vancouver's FIFA preparations reveals just how much demand these matches will create. Vancouver is short **70,000 accommodation nights** over nine days. Up to **15,000 fans per day** won't find hotel rooms. And hotel rates? They're expected to spike by **200%**.

Toronto is hosting FIFA matches too. And unlike Vancouver, we're not in crisis mode. That means GTA hosts can actually prepare and profit.

## What Vancouver's Shortage Means for Your Toronto Rental

Vancouver's problem is your opportunity. Here's why.

The city restricted short-term rentals so heavily that they can't handle the surge. Hotels are maxed out. Fans will look for alternatives. Some will stay in nearby cities. Some will skip Vancouver entirely.

Toronto doesn't have the same capacity crunch. We've got a healthy mix of hotels and Airbnbs. But demand during FIFA will still outstrip supply. Economics 101: when demand exceeds supply, prices go up.

The hosts who prepare now will capture those premium rates.

## How to Price Your Airbnb for FIFA

Forget your regular pricing strategy during major events. Here's what actually works.

**Start tracking comparable events now.** Look at what Toronto rentals charged during past high-demand periods. TIFF, Caribana, major concerts at Rogers Centre. Check what similar properties listed for, and more importantly, what they actually booked at.

**Set your FIFA dates early.** Block off the match days in Toronto once they're announced. You can always adjust pricing, but you want those dates protected.

**Price aggressively, but not greedily.** A 200% increase sounds crazy, but if hotels are charging $600 a night, your $400 condo suddenly looks reasonable. Price relative to alternatives, not your usual rate.

**Require longer minimum stays.** Fans traveling for FIFA often stay for multiple matches. A 3-night minimum filters out the one-night party crowd and attracts guests who'll treat your place well.

**Update your listing now.** Mention proximity to BMO Field and the venues. Add transit directions. International visitors will search for these specifics.

## The Numbers You Should Know

Vancouver's projected losses from their accommodation shortage:
- **$78 million CAD** in economic impact across B.C.
- **$4 million** in lost tax revenue

That's money visitors wanted to spend but couldn't because there weren't enough places to stay.

Toronto won't have that problem. Our Airbnb market can absorb significant demand. But "enough supply" doesn't mean "cheap rates." It means hosts who position well will book at premium prices.

## Beyond FIFA: Major Events in the GTA

The FIFA pricing playbook works for every major event. Toronto hosts see demand spikes throughout the year:

**Annual events:** TIFF (September), CNE (August), Caribana (August), Pride (June)

**Sports:** Blue Jays playoffs, Raptors games, Leafs home games, major concerts

**Business travel:** Conference season, corporate events, trade shows

Each of these is a pricing opportunity. The hosts making real money in Toronto aren't using static pricing. They're adjusting for every major event that drives visitors to the city.

## What Smart Hosts Are Doing Right Now

The countdown to FIFA 2026 is already running. Here's your checklist:

**Get your listing in shape.** Professional photos, updated descriptions, accurate amenities. When FIFA travelers search Toronto, you want to stand out.

**Set up dynamic pricing.** Whether you do it manually or use tools, your rates should flex with demand. Static pricing during FIFA is leaving money on the table.

**Know your competition.** What are other Airbnbs in your neighborhood charging during events? What are nearby hotels listing at? This data drives your pricing decisions.

**Prepare for international guests.** Clear check-in instructions, translation-friendly communication, info about transit and local restaurants. FIFA brings visitors from around the world.

## The Bottom Line

Vancouver's FIFA accommodation crisis isn't your problem. It's your opportunity.

Toronto hosts who prepare now will capture premium rates during one of the biggest events the city has ever hosted. The same strategy works for every major event on the calendar.
