Making a bed might seem simple, but there's a big difference between how you make your own bed at home and how you should prepare a bed for paying guests. The way you present your beds can make or break a guest's first impression.

Here's the thing: most hosts and cleaners are doing bed making wrong. They're either rushing through it or not thinking about the guest experience. But getting this right isn't just about looking good in photos (though that matters too). It's about creating that "wow" moment when guests walk into the bedroom.

## Start with Quality Basics

Before you even think about making techniques, you need the right foundation. Invest in good sheets, pillowcases, and duvet covers. White or neutral colors work best because they photograph well and give that clean, hotel-like feel guests expect.

Don't cheap out here. Scratchy sheets will get you bad reviews faster than almost anything else. Your guests are paying premium rates for short-term rentals in Toronto, so they expect premium comfort.

## The Professional Technique

Hospital corners aren't just for hospitals. This technique keeps sheets tight and wrinkle-free, even after guests toss and turn all night. It looks professional and stays neat longer than loose sheets.

Start with your fitted sheet, making sure it's pulled tight at all corners. Then add your top sheet with about 8 inches hanging over at the foot of the bed. Fold the excess under the mattress at a 45-degree angle, then tuck the sides. This creates those crisp, clean lines you see in luxury hotels.

## Pillow Presentation Matters

Here's where most people mess up. Just throwing pillows at the head of the bed doesn't cut it. Arrange pillows consistently across all your bedrooms. If you have multiple properties, use the same style everywhere.

Two pillows per person is standard, but consider adding a decorative pillow or throw for visual appeal. Just don't go overboard. Guests want somewhere to sleep, not a pillow obstacle course.

## The Final Touches

Smooth out any wrinkles by hand. Check that the duvet or comforter is evenly distributed and hanging the same length on both sides. These small details matter more than you think.

Take a step back and look at the bed from the doorway. That's the view your guests will see first. Does it look inviting? Professional? Would you be excited to sleep there?

## Train Your Cleaning Team

If you're working with cleaners (and you should be), make sure they know your standards. Create a simple checklist or photo guide showing exactly how you want beds made. Don't assume they know what you want.

Schedule periodic check-ins to ensure quality stays consistent. Good cleaners want to do great work, but they need clear expectations.

## Why This Matters for Your Business

Guests notice bed quality immediately. It's one of the first things they'll mention in reviews, either positively or negatively. A perfectly made bed signals that you care about details throughout the property.

Plus, well-made beds photograph better for your listing photos. Those crisp lines and smooth surfaces make bedrooms look more spacious and inviting online.

## Making It Sustainable

The goal isn't just to make beautiful beds, but to create a system that works consistently. Whether you're doing the work yourself or managing a cleaning team, having clear standards makes everything run smoother.

Document your process. Take photos of properly made beds from different angles. This gives you and your team a reference to maintain quality over time.

Managing all these details while running a successful [short-term rental business](/services/short-term-rental-management-toronto) takes serious time and attention.
